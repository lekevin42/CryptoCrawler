STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM BAIKALMINER.COM !!! After weeks of research on Google and Youtube, I thought the Baikal Miner would be a good investment mining Dash coins at 300 MH/s using only 75 Watt of power. Boy was I in for the biggest SCAM and RIPOFF and RIDE of my life!!! After one month of Baikal Miner hustling and scamming me, he stole $4676 and I am now stuck with a defective Baikal Miner Cube. I am now still SHOCK and SO DISGUSTED of these people! This is why they don\u2019t accept credit card or paypal. Just bitcoin, dash or ethereum. I don\u2019t think there is any recourse or any way you can get the coins back from these people!\n \n\tOn April 11, 2017, I pulled the trigger and sent baikalminer 0.7216068 BTC which equals to $876.02 USD. These people are very difficult to deal with and very slow to respond on email. Worst, they only take bitcoin and they are located halfway around the world in China. So this made me very concern. 8 days later on April 19, the unit arrived at my home. I emailed Baikal on what power supply to use and they won\u2019t recommend which power supply to buy or send me an ebay or Amazon link, they just said 12V 10A. I searched on Google, Amazon and ebay and end up buying 3 power supply from Amazon and ebay. The first P/S came home the end plug was too big and did not fit. Then a couple days later the two P/S I ordered on ebay arrived and this one fit. You would think spending $876 on a little box with a fan, heatsink and circuit board they would include a P/S. The box did not come with any manuals so I had to google to find the CUBE.pdf manual and figured everything out myself. When first powered up and log in with the default password baikal, the miner show down. It looks like they still have their dash wallet address on there. I setup an account on coinmine.pl and dash.suprnova.cc and added my account and dash wallet address to the Baikal Pool page. Doesn\u2019t matter what I do, the miner still show down.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tOn April 24, 2017, I emailed  . The following day, they email back ask me to skype them.\n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tOn Skype, they did not offer any technical support or troubleshooting at all. They kept on insisting I download and read the CUBE.pdf file.\n \n\tTheir support is shitty!\u00a0 Then they wanted me to ship the unit back at my expense to repair it.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t happy at all!!!\u00a0 To make me happy, they offered a Quad unit at a discounted price.\u00a0 The miner cube is $800 + $76 Shipping.\u00a0 Total is $876.\u00a0 Quad is 4 miner cube so $800 x 4 = $3200.\u00a0 I already paid for the first miner cube so I just need to pay for the difference of $2326 and I have to ship the defective unit back.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t happy paying more at a full price when I already received a defective unit.\u00a0 So they offer 5% discount + free shipping + power cable at $2166 more + $876 I originally paid.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t>4/25 Ok I will deduct the same so that you can pay the shipping price from your end for that cube.\n \n\t>4/25 3196-870 = 2326$\n \n\t>4/25 But you have to ship the product to us.\n \n\t>4/25 Does it make you happy..\n \n\t>4/25 Ok as this is our fault we give the 5% + free shipping and power cable = 3036- 870 = 2166\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tOn April 27 and 30, 2017, I sent them $2150 to upgrade to a Quad Cube ($900 in ETH and $1250 in BTC).\u00a0 As of this date, I have sent them\n \n\t$3026.02.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tOn May 1, 2017, they offer me two baikal quads for $2400 instead of instead of $3400 .\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t>5/1 Ok after lot of considerations in your case we feel like the fault is from our end only.\n \n\tAnd to do the compensation for that if you are interested we ship out two baikal quads in which you have already paid for one and for the second one we give you 25% off + free power cables and shipping. So you have to pay 2400$ instead of 3400$ I this this makes you a happy customer.\n \n\tWhat do you say.?\n \n\t>5/1 This is only one time offer please don't consider this discount in future just to make sure you should be happy we are offering this and please post this any where in social media.\n \n\tAs people will start bargaining..\n \n\tThis offer for you also only once from next time please don't ask us as definitely we don't give any offers anymore.\n \n\tDefinitely you don't need to worry this time as I personally test the products which we are going to send you.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t>5/2 Hello my friend we have received your payment\n \n\tBut we had an issue with our financial tem.\n \n\tIn the morning our jr accountant accepted that you can pay 1600$ later but from afternoon we had so many discussions and our Sr accountant is not agreeing for more than 1000$ credit to a customer and blaming me for giving such credit after 25% discount.\n \n\tSome how I managed by telling that customer lost a lot because of the machine problem and managed to give you 1200$ or with huge extra offer.\n \n\tBecause we consider the money which we get before the shipping and after shipping we always will be having 50:50.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tCase1) pay 1000$ and pay nothing except shipping the old product.\n \n\tSo here for second quad you will be getting 3400-1600 = 1800$ total to pay(800 already paid and balance 1000$). Close to 47% off on total for the second machine.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tCase 2) pay 400$ now and remaining 1200$ after shipping.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tThis is just to make sure that it is fine at least we don't make profit but we should not lose money by selling.\n \n\tWe sell our products through out the world and you are an individual customer for us.\n \n\tI hope you understand our Sr accountant concern.\n \n\tPlease think for a while and let me know which case suits well so that I will proceed and also please be hurry so that tomorrow morning hours I would like to ship them.

I have a dummy acc which i'm learning to trade with and plan to make some investments but it's early days and i'm being cautious. The main question i have is do you have the same loss to exchange crypto to crypto as you do when you go from fiat to crypto? I think when i bought my dummy investments i lost about 10% and i was wondering what happens when you exit to Fiat Currency, do you incur the same loss\u00a0again, can this be limited to moving investments to\u00a0USDT instead of fiat if for example you want to take a pause and not leave investments in the crypto currencies.\n \n\tI appreciate any light that can be shed on this topic.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t\u00a0Thanks!\n", "postAuthor": "JnyRotten", "postDate": "05/18/2017 04:08  PM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Brand New", "authorPostCount": 0, "postLikes": 0},

Also, if you have interests in time-series modeling/machine learning for forecasting I'm definitely down to work with others on automated trading systems. To get a sense of my work you can also check out my other app:   which lets users build quant finance models on the go in an easy to use way.

The coin has been around for a while but recent developments are a game-changer.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t4 reasons:\u00a0\n \n\ti) It will be\u00a0 (probably by year-end 2017), which enables seamless P2P transfer across different blockchains (thus reducing the need for centralized exchanges). This is important because centralized store of value is the key point of failure and the weakness of the blockchain currently. The other coin planning to activate the atomic swap is Litecoin. In fact, the two are planning to partner each other to jointly achieve this goal -\u00a0 .\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tii) Valuation: While Litecoin has already seen a massive run-up, with a market cap of over US$2 billion, Vertcoin has a market cap of about US$20 million. Crazy undervalued.\u00a0\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tiii) Vertcoin is ASIC-resistant, meaning it is designed to avoid being mined by a small handful of miners with large computing power. This is a unique benefit in a time when the market has been worrying over too much miner control on the blockchain.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tiv) Vertcoin's mining reward is set to halve in December 2017 (once every 4 years), which tends to support prices - if not in terms of a rally, then at least pushing the floor on the price higher (as miners would not sell a coin for less than it costs to mine, in theory).\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t \u00a0I believe it is a lack of awareness, as the coin has been around for a while (since Jan 2014), but it is only recently (mid-2017) when major developments like the implementation of Segwit and being code-ready for the Lightning Network - leading to the plan to implement atomic swaps - have happened. I'm recommending my friends to buy in while the price is still low, and hold for the medium-term. Could be a 100x-bagger. Of course, don't put everything in, unless you have a very high risk tolerance.\n", "postAuthor": "MarkT09450789", "postDate": "08/15/2017 01:03  PM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Brand New", "authorPostCount": 0, "postLikes": 0},
{"url": "https://www.cryptotalk.org/index.php?/topic/733-particl-is-a-decentralized-privacy-platform-built-for-global-p2p-ecommerce-part/", "postText": "\n\t \n\t \n\tAmazon is 22 years old, eBay is 21. The online services we use are increasingly demanding more of our personal data, a disturbing trend. Corporate entities such as Google and Facebook have grown to extraordinary sizes solely by monetizing on user data. These entities are charged with keeping said data secure and, in the case of social and economic interactions, safeguarding the privacy. This approach of centralized security models is not applicable to the new generation of technologies such as Bitcoin.\n \n\t \n\tSatoshi Nakamoto had initially created a marketplace which was included in the official Bitcoin codebase  . The concept of a decentralized marketplace in itself is not novel, there have been a small set of academic constructions and even serious attempts at creating them. ( ,  ,  ,  ) They either propose solutions that scale extremely well and neglect the privacy implications, or they propose very privacy conscious solutions that do not scale well. Privacy and efficiency are often at odds with each other.\n \n\t[align=center] [/align]\n \n\tTor exemplifies this well, the traffic is pushed through various nodes with several layers of encryption before arriving at its destination, it is deliberately inefficient but the privacy provided by the trade off is well worth it. And then there's governance and how do you attach a self-governance mechanism on a decentralized network? The issue of governance on decentralized models is already starting to become a hot button for blockchain platforms.\n \n\t \n\tParticl is an open source, decentralized privacy platform built for global person to person eCommerce. The native marketplace, currency tokens and suite of encrypted communication tools offer unfettered access between buyers and sellers worldwide or just down the street.\n \n\tYou can buy or sell anything, similar to eBay, Etsy or Amazon, except that all the transaction data, payments and conversations happen over a self-governed, distributed network instead of a central server. Think of it as going to a local market to buy something you need, from the person who is actually selling it, without a third person's permission, \"service\" or fee required for the sale to happen.\u00a0\n \n\tPART is the native 2-token currency in Particl. Users have a choice when sending money on the distributed ledger. Pseudo-anonymous transactions use a public token and truly-anonymous transactions use a private token.\n \n\tParticl will be currency agnostic, meaning it will support the use of many cryptocurrencies with the intent of being an inclusive platform. A decentralized privacy platform focused on free markets cannot be limited by its own built-in token system. Our goal is to lower barriers of entry and reduce friction in online shopping, allowing for easier adoption by buyers and vendors anywhere in the world.\u00a0\n \n\tThe very nature of a free-market built on a distributed network immediately brings up the question of governance. To get right to the point, Particl is being built with protection to ensure the market does not become an ultimate version of silk road. Our main focus is researching self-governance models that can be adapted to a decentralized network. The self-governance model for Particl will have two components to it:\n \n\t*   Protection against illegal goods. \"How do we protect the platform?\" \n\t*   Providing user privacy. \"How do we protect the users?\"\n \n\t \n\tParticl core developers\n \n\t* Ryno Mathee - Lead & Core Developer (ryno@particl.io) (rynomster) \n\t* Gerlof van Ek - \u00a0Developer, Branding & Graphics, UI/UX (gerlof@particl.io) (crz) \n\t* Ido Kaiser - Developer & Software Architect (kewde) \n\t* Tecnovert - Core Developer, Cryptographic Researcher \n\t* Shazzy - Research & Development (shazzy@particl.io) (dasource)\n \n\t \n\tParticl non-developer core\n \n\t* Paul Schmitzer - Communications (paul@particl.io) (litebit) \n\t* Henk Swardt - Project Manager, PMP (henk@particl.io) \n\t* Nick Sy - Treasurer (nick@particl.io)\n \n\t \n\tExtended Team:\n \n\t* Arcanum - PR / Writing \n\t* FFmad - General Relations \n\t* Edu - Community Manager \n\t* Allien - Front-end Developer \n\t* Ludx - Developer\n \n\t \n\tAdvisors:\n \n\t* Micah Spruill - Business & Finance - Managing Partner, Aurora Investment Advisors (micah@particl.io) \n\t* Yann Alleman - Business & PR, - Engineer, Ferrari A.G. (yann@particl.io) \n\t* Joe Fisher - E-Commerce Strategy - Private label online seller, Product Developer (joe@particl.io)\n \n\t \n\tParticl is based on the latest and market-leading Bitcoin codebase. We are currently adding the privacy functionality from ShadowCash onto the Bitcoin Core 13.2 codebase but with .14 released in March it is highly likely that by the time we create the Particl genesis block we will be on Bitcoin Core .14 codebase.\n \n\t \n\tA seed round is scheduled to start March 18th, 2017 and last 4 weeks. During this time existing ShadowCash token holders can exchange SDC for PART.\u00a0\n \n\tTo participate in the Particl token exchange, you must have ShadowCash (SDC) tokens. \n\tPlease visit   for investment inquiries and information.\n \n\t \n\tWebsite:  \n\tReddit:  \n\tBlog:  \n\tTwitter:  \n\tSlack:   | Slack invite:  \n\tRiot:  \n\tIRC: #particl \n\tGithub:  \n \n\t \n\tGeneral queries: hello@particl.io\n", "postAuthor": "vindyne8", "postDate": "06/20/2017 07:25  PM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Legendary Member", "authorPostCount": "16", "postLikes": 0},

This thread is a continuation of   Syscoin is unique fintech asset that offers much more than simple currency transfer. Syscoin provide an entire marketplace ecosystem built around the SYS token but cross-compatible with Bitcoin (BTC) as well. Unlike many coins the features below are not   they are   launched April 30th, 2016 as version 2.0. Value from the 1.0 chain as of block 880510 was migrated to the 2.0.\n\t \n\t\t\u00a0\n\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\t\t*   \u2013 Provides improved scalability to the core syscoin blockchain by efficiently pruning expired service data to minimize blockchain bloat for full nodes. \n\t\t*   \u2013 Syscoin Aliases are now unique across the network; a change from Syscoin 2.0 where variable-case aliases were permitted. \n\t\t*   \u2013 Optional passwords attached to aliases provide for portability and restoration options not possible on Syscoin 2.0 including the ability to recover an account simply by using the related Alias password. \n\t\t*   \u2013 Two tiers of marketplace moderation both user-defined via SafeSearch and team-defined via a 3 tier system. The moderation system allows for a more public-friendly marketplace with options for SafeSearch restricted items. \n\t\t*   \u2013 Syscoin users can now leverage ZEC as a direct payment option, which natively includes enhanced privacy. \n\t\t*   \u2013 Offers can now be paid for in any currency supported by the marketplace and supported by the merchants. Rather than one specific currency, payments can be now be made using all three supported blockchains (SYS, BTC and ZEC). \n\t\t*   \u2013 Aliases, Certificates and Offers, now support multi-signature transactions, enabling a whole new class of use cases for Syscoin services. \n\t\t*   \u2013 As outlined in the launch of Syscoin 2.0, the importance of keeping up-to-date with the latest bitcoin technology is essential for Syscoin to thrive; thus, we planned on keeping up to date with the latest Bitcoin core. Keeping up-to-date will be accomplished by upgrading the Syscoin 2.1 update to Bitcoin\u2019s latest core 0.13.99. \n\t\t*   \u2013 Escrow was previously only available on offers purchased using Syscoin. With Syscoin 2.1, Escrow will now be available on offers purchased with any currency accepted, SYS, BTC or ZEC. \n\t\t*   \u2013 Aliases now include a private field which is visible only to the owner of the alias, allowing for private data storage on the blockchain. \n\t\t*   \u2013 There is now support for default Alias and default price-peg selection, increasing wallet usability. All service screens now also include the option to view all services the wallet owns or view services by individual Alias. \n\t\t*   \u2013 Fee information is now stored in the Alias rates peg allowing for dynamic fees specifically for Syscoin services. This enables different fee structures with different pegs and gives merchants more flexibility in pricing. \n\t\t*   \u2013 Optionally allows merchants to notify customers that an item has been shipped. \n\t\t*   \u2013 A 5-star feedback and rating system can now be provided for Merchants, Customers and Arbitrators, ensuring an accurate representation of reputation history for all parties. \n\t\t*   \u2013 Easy unlock mechanism for improved usability w/encrypted wallets. \n\t\t*   \u2013 Hide items that have are sold out or expired from wallet listing screens. \n\t\t*   \u2013 Search within a specific category rather than always searching all categories. \n\t\t*   \u2013 A standardized set of categories across the Syscoin marketplace, or use your own. \n\t\t*   \u2013 Optionally add geolocation to offers. \n\t\t*   - Mining schedule advanced from 6% inflation to 1.5% inflation. \n\t\t*  \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\t\t* All features use blockchain technology \n\t\t* Decentralized Marketplace \n\t\t* Name Aliases for easier addressing \n\t\t* Full Affiliate system for reselling, reseller discounts, and more \n\t\t* Private selling \n\t\t* Encrypted Messaging \n\t\t* Digital Certificates on the blockchain which can be directly sold on the Marketplace \n\t\t* Decentralized price pegging \n\t\t* Third party arbitrated escrow for secure transactions and buying with confidence\n\t \n\t\tWe have much more development planned throughout 2016 and beyond as well.

AirFox is positioned to create mobile capital for advertisers, users, and carriers using the blockchain. AirFox uses advertising and micro-loans on the blockchain to unlock unrealized mobile capital through a new cryptocurrency - The AirToken. \n\t___\n \n\t \n\t- Over the last year, AirFox\u2019s business-to-business platform has enabled more than 2 million unique U.S. prepaid wireless subscribers to reduce their mobile costs while helping wireless carriers better serve their customers. \n\t___ \n\t- AirFox Android Apps powered by the AirToken blockchain AirFox\u2019s free Android apps,   and  , enable any prepaid mobile subscriber on Earth to earn AirTokens. With both apps, users are rewarded in AirTokens for every ad impression on their device. Users can then exchange those AirTokens for mobile data or use them to send mobile data to others via 3.5B prepaid SIM cards and over 500 wireless carriers. Eventually users will also be able to claim micro-loans of AirTokens.\n \n\t-   - Browse, Save & Earn\n \n\t- The AirFox Browser blocks outside advertising and trackers that raditionally consume over 50% of a user\u2019s data plan. Once Android users download the AirFox Browser, they gain fast internet access and can use their mobile data more efficiently. \n\t- Users can opt-in to non-incentivized ads from AirFox and those will appear in the browser periodically. Users earn AirTokens by opting in to AirFox ads.\n \n\t-   - Earn, Buy & Save\u00a0\n \n\t- In this app, users can opt to view advertisements and complete offers (complete surveys, install apps, watch videos, purchase goods, etc) to earn AirTokens. The amount of AirTokens each offer is worth is displayed to the user before they accept the offer. \n\t- Ads are periodically displayed on a user\u2019s smartphone after certain events; for example, a call is ended or the phone is unlocked.\u00a0 \n\t- Users can also purchase AirTokens directly within the AirFox Recharge app using their local currency in certain countries where AirFox has integrated this service. In the United States, a credit card can purchase AirTokens. \n\t- Eventually this app will also grant microloans of AirTokens to AirFox users based on smartphone data. \n\t___\n \n\t : \n\t___ \n\t-  \n\t-  \n", "postAuthor": "vindyne8", "postDate": "08/13/2017 04:23  PM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Legendary Member", "authorPostCount": "16", "postLikes": 0},

With this innovation it is now possible to execute smart contracts and run decentralized applications, simply and securely, in environments that were previously out of reach for Ethereum, combining the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts with the stability and maturity of the bitcoin ecosystem.\n \n\tUntil now, attempts to implement smart contract solutions on top of the bitcoin blockchain have had issues, been lackluster, or failed to break into the mainstream business market. This is primarily due to the fact that the bitcoin blockchain employs an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) scheme to associate coins with addresses, rather than the easier to understand, but otherwise problematic, account-based model used by Ethereum.\n \n\tAn account based model works pretty much the way one would imagine:\u00a0 if Alice has 10 tokens, and sends 5 of them to Bob, who has zero tokens; 5 tokens are simply subtracted from Alice\u2019s balance and added to Bob\u2019s, who now owns 5 coins.\u00a0 On a UTXO blockchain, however, Alice does not directly hold 10 tokens, but a series of outputs, which are collections of coins resulting from previous transactions.\n \n\tIn such a model, instead of owning 10 tokens, Alice would, for example, hold 3 outputs: (a) consisting of 6 coins, (b) consisting of 2 coins, and (c) consisting of another 2 coins. In this scenario Alice couldn\u2019t simply send 5 coins to Bob, but instead she (or her wallet, for that matter) would have to pick the best-suited output and receive \u201cchange\u201d in return (a process called coin picking). In our example this means that Alice would transfer output (a), consisting of 6 coins, and receive 1 coin back as \u201cchange\u201d. This \u201cchange\u201d is what is called the Unspent Transaction Output, or UTXO. After the transaction Alice would still hold 3 outputs, this time (a) consisting of 1, while (b) and (c) remain 2.\n \n\tEmploying such a seemingly complex bookkeeping scheme allows the Bitcoin blockchain to support Simple Payment Verifications or SPVs. The SPV protocol enables the support of light wallets, which are wallets that can interact with the Bitcoin network in a decentralized and trustless manner, without having to download the entire Bitcoin blockchain. This property is immensely useful for mobile applications or in any low bandwidth/storage environment.\n \n\tUntil now, Ethereum smart contracts couldn't execute in such environments exactly because Ethereum\u2019s account based blockchain does not provide a SPV analog. To solve this, Qtum builds its decentralized application platform on the proven-to-deliver Bitcoin blockchain and introduces the Qtum Account Abstract Layer, which serves as a communication layer between the Bitcoin Core 0.13 protocol and the EVM.\n \n\tTo achieve this, Qtum has extended the Bitcoin 'Script' language, adding 3 \u2018opcodes\u2019 so that it functions as a vehicle to transport code to the EVM, while adding special processing conditions, executing these EVM-using transactions immediately when added to the blockchain - allowing the EVM to operate within a UTXO environment.\n \n\tIn order to relieve Qtum smart contracts from the need to perform coin picking for every transaction, Qtum comes coded with an automated, generic coin picking algorithm which allows contracts to ignore the UTXO mode of operation, while functioning normally, as if deployed in an account-based environment. This method is what enables Qtum to be compatible with pre-existing Ethereum smart contracts, allowing them to be executed on Qtum with little to no change to their code.\n \n\tFor more information about Qtum\u2019s architecture in general, please read this post or review our\u00a0 Technical Whitepaper.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n\t \n \n", "postAuthor": "vindyne8", "postDate": "03/09/2017 08:25  PM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Legendary Member", "authorPostCount": "16", "postLikes": 0},

The more people we meet, the more questions we get asked, but they tend to start with the basics. What is Blockchain? What are tokens? Where\u2019s the meaning in the Qtum project? What\u2019s the difference between Qtum, EOS, Ethereum, and every other blockchain? And, what\u2019s the difference between an ICO and equity financing? \n\t___ \n\tFor many of these questions, it\u2019s difficult to have an accurate understanding. There are many reasons causing this problem. One being that blockchain technology is a combination of a concept of technological change and organizational change, which can be difficult to explain to the general public. \n\t___ \n\tBefore 2014, the industry didn\u2019t have an idea of what is a blockchain. From 2009\u20132014, industry practitioners just called everything a coin or cryptocurrency. Since 2014, the industry has changed to advancing beyond the technology being used for its financial attributes. \n\t___ \n\tBlockchain networks themselves are a complex set of systems and software engineering, mathematical principles, cryptography, network architecture, consensus mechanisms, and economic models. Without the cultivation of higher education in a science and engineering background, it\u2019s difficult to understand. \n\t___ \n\tExpecting everyone to understand the technology behind the blockchain, the innovations in the space and get an accurate understanding of the project, is similar to expecting everyone to understand the concept of partial derivatives in calculus, and binary entropy functions. For the most part, fewer than 1% of the population will every truly understand all these different aspects that make the technology what it is. \n\t___ \n\tThis is why, most of the time, explaining blockchain technology to \u201cCEOs,\u201d \u201cjournalists,\u201d or \u201canonymous\u201d and having them try to make a judgment of a project, is especially hard. No matter how intelligent a person is, most people limit their expertise to a particular field. \n\t___ \n\tIf blockchain technology itself were only a simple technology innovation, it wouldn\u2019t have caused such a massive uproar between scientists, economists, mathematicians, government officials, the press and so forth. The blockchain is the essence of change in what we can conceptualize. \n\t___ \n\tIn the form of organization reconstruction, the transformation of social collaboration mechanisms, pooling together, creating a new concept. This concept is ordinarily difficult to recognize all of a sudden, and even if we understand it clearly, it can be difficult to accept. \n\t___ \n\tIf someone told you, in the next 30 years, perhaps all the companies will disappear, everyone will say you are a crazy. But this kind of \u201ccompany\u201d organizational structure, in the thousands of years of human history, has only existed for 300 years. \n\t___ \n\tBlockchain development can make humanity quickly establish a new kind of \u201corganization structure,\u201d this kind of autonomous organization structure exists on the blockchain network, protocol, and in our minds. Everyone can grasp the idea of a company. But I feel the next era will be this is a protocol-based commonwealth. \n\t___ \n\tA protocol-based commonwealth with the development of Internet and blockchain technology will make virtual organizations become mainstream in the next 10 to 20 years. \n\t___ \n\t___ :  \n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t\u00a0\n", "postAuthor": "vindyne8", "postDate": "08/08/2017 10:51  PM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Legendary Member", "authorPostCount": "16", "postLikes": 0},

With this innovation it is now possible to execute smart contracts and run decentralized applications, simply and securely, in environments that were previously out of reach for Ethereum, combining the endless possibilities provided by smart contracts with the stability and maturity of the bitcoin ecosystem.\n \n\tUntil now, attempts to implement smart contract solutions on top of the bitcoin blockchain have had issues, been lackluster, or failed to break into the mainstream business market. This is primarily due to the fact that the bitcoin blockchain employs an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) scheme to associate coins with addresses, rather than the easier to understand, but otherwise problematic, account-based model used by Ethereum.\n \n\tAn account based model works pretty much the way one would imagine:\u00a0 if Alice has 10 tokens, and sends 5 of them to Bob, who has zero tokens; 5 tokens are simply subtracted from Alice\u2019s balance and added to Bob\u2019s, who now owns 5 coins.\u00a0 On a UTXO blockchain, however, Alice does not directly hold 10 tokens, but a series of outputs, which are collections of coins resulting from previous transactions.\n \n\tIn such a model, instead of owning 10 tokens, Alice would, for example, hold 3 outputs: (a) consisting of 6 coins, (b) consisting of 2 coins, and (c) consisting of another 2 coins. In this scenario Alice couldn\u2019t simply send 5 coins to Bob, but instead she (or her wallet, for that matter) would have to pick the best-suited output and receive \u201cchange\u201d in return (a process called coin picking). In our example this means that Alice would transfer output (a), consisting of 6 coins, and receive 1 coin back as \u201cchange\u201d. This \u201cchange\u201d is what is called the Unspent Transaction Output, or UTXO. After the transaction Alice would still hold 3 outputs, this time (a) consisting of 1, while (b) and (c) remain 2.\n \n\tEmploying such a seemingly complex bookkeeping scheme allows the Bitcoin blockchain to support Simple Payment Verifications or SPVs. The SPV protocol enables the support of light wallets, which are wallets that can interact with the Bitcoin network in a decentralized and trustless manner, without having to download the entire Bitcoin blockchain. This property is immensely useful for mobile applications or in any low bandwidth/storage environment.\n \n\tUntil now, Ethereum smart contracts couldn't execute in such environments exactly because Ethereum\u2019s account based blockchain does not provide a SPV analog. To solve this, Qtum builds its decentralized application platform on the proven-to-deliver Bitcoin blockchain and introduces the Qtum Account Abstract Layer, which serves as a communication layer between the Bitcoin Core 0.13 protocol and the EVM.\n \n\tTo achieve this, Qtum has extended the Bitcoin 'Script' language, adding 3 \u2018opcodes\u2019 so that it functions as a vehicle to transport code to the EVM, while adding special processing conditions, executing these EVM-using transactions immediately when added to the blockchain - allowing the EVM to operate within a UTXO environment.\n \n\tIn order to relieve Qtum smart contracts from the need to perform coin picking for every transaction, Qtum comes coded with an automated, generic coin picking algorithm which allows contracts to ignore the UTXO mode of operation, while functioning normally, as if deployed in an account-based environment. This method is what enables Qtum to be compatible with pre-existing Ethereum smart contracts, allowing them to be executed on Qtum with little to no change to their code.\n \n\tFor more information about Qtum\u2019s architecture in general, please read this post or review our\u00a0 Technical Whitepaper.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n\t \n \n", "postAuthor": "vindyne8", "postDate": "03/09/2017 08:25  PM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Legendary Member", "authorPostCount": "16", "postLikes": 0},

And, what\u2019s the difference between an ICO and equity financing? \n\t___ \n\tFor many of these questions, it\u2019s difficult to have an accurate understanding. There are many reasons causing this problem. One being that blockchain technology is a combination of a concept of technological change and organizational change, which can be difficult to explain to the general public. \n\t___ \n\tBefore 2014, the industry didn\u2019t have an idea of what is a blockchain. From 2009\u20132014, industry practitioners just called everything a coin or cryptocurrency. Since 2014, the industry has changed to advancing beyond the technology being used for its financial attributes. \n\t___ \n\tBlockchain networks themselves are a complex set of systems and software engineering, mathematical principles, cryptography, network architecture, consensus mechanisms, and economic models. Without the cultivation of higher education in a science and engineering background, it\u2019s difficult to understand. \n\t___ \n\tExpecting everyone to understand the technology behind the blockchain, the innovations in the space and get an accurate understanding of the project, is similar to expecting everyone to understand the concept of partial derivatives in calculus, and binary entropy functions. For the most part, fewer than 1% of the population will every truly understand all these different aspects that make the technology what it is. \n\t___ \n\tThis is why, most of the time, explaining blockchain technology to \u201cCEOs,\u201d \u201cjournalists,\u201d or \u201canonymous\u201d and having them try to make a judgment of a project, is especially hard. No matter how intelligent a person is, most people limit their expertise to a particular field. \n\t___ \n\tIf blockchain technology itself were only a simple technology innovation, it wouldn\u2019t have caused such a massive uproar between scientists, economists, mathematicians, government officials, the press and so forth. The blockchain is the essence of change in what we can conceptualize. \n\t___ \n\tIn the form of organization reconstruction, the transformation of social collaboration mechanisms, pooling together, creating a new concept. This concept is ordinarily difficult to recognize all of a sudden, and even if we understand it clearly, it can be difficult to accept. \n\t___ \n\tIf someone told you, in the next 30 years, perhaps all the companies will disappear, everyone will say you are a crazy. But this kind of \u201ccompany\u201d organizational structure, in the thousands of years of human history, has only existed for 300 years. \n\t___ \n\tBlockchain development can make humanity quickly establish a new kind of \u201corganization structure,\u201d this kind of autonomous organization structure exists on the blockchain network, protocol, and in our minds. Everyone can grasp the idea of a company. But I feel the next era will be this is a protocol-based commonwealth. \n\t___ \n\tA protocol-based commonwealth with the development of Internet and blockchain technology will make virtual organizations become mainstream in the next 10 to 20 years. \n\t___ \n\t___ :  \n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t\u00a0\n", "postAuthor": "vindyne8", "postDate": "08/08/2017 10:51  PM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Legendary Member", "authorPostCount": "16", "postLikes": 0},

50% distributed coins and will start a new phase of our distribution. \n\t___ \n\tIt was stated from day one that the purpose of this distribution is to get this coin into the hands of as many people as possible. \u00a0Both coins (bytes and blackbytes) are meant to be used as currencies, and this is only possible when there are many users and apps to interact with. \u00a0We already have a sizable community, a number of unique apps, and we are the only crypto project to have an app distribution platform (the Bot Store), but there is still a lot of room to grow in terms of user count, number of apps, and willingness of users to use these apps. \n\t___ \n\tUp until now, we were distributing only to   of BTC and Bytes, i.e. we were rewarding holding. \u00a0Now we are adding actual   into the mix, i.e. we are going to reward transactions. \n\t___ \n\tTo get you an idea of how we are going to do it, we are going to partner with several categories of companies:\n \n\t- merchants \n\t- payment processors \n\t- \"Bitcoin debit card\" companies \n\tand offer 10% cashback, paid in Bytes, for all qualifying purchases (no matter how the purchases are paid). \u00a0The cashback will be funded from the undistributed pool. \u00a0For example, a customer who bought for $100 receives $10 cashback in Bytes, paid to his Byteball address, at the current exchange rate. \u00a0For merchants, this is something that would drive sales and they would put effort into promoting the offer. \u00a0In competitive industries, a 10% cashback is a very powerful tool to lure customers. \u00a0For customers, this is a 10% discount (which matters a lot in some industries). \u00a0For Byteball, it is new users who will have to get involved into the system in order to receive the cashback. \n\t___ \n\tA few companies have already expressed interest (not disclosing the names while it is a work in progress). \n\t___ \n\tA few extensions of this offer:\n \n\t- 20% cashback if the purchase is paid in bytes or blackbytes. \u00a0This would incentivize merchants to start accepting bytes and blackbytes, and the infrastructure will stay after the distribution ends. \n\t- merchants can offer additional cashback to their customers. \u00a0Merchants fund it themselves by buying bytes from the market, and for every 1% funded by the merchant we add 1% more from the undistributed pool. \n\t___ \n\tIf you see similarity with existing loyalty points schemes, it is similar indeed. \n\t___ \n\tAt a minimum, we receive many new users who learn about Byteball from their merchants, plus working payment integrations. \u00a0And the users are not just crypto fans, it may be their first crypto coin for many users. \u00a0With the most user friendly wallet in the industry, we are in the best position to expand beyond the crypto village. \n\t___ \n\tWe can continue adding 10-20% to existing byte balances to incentivize keeping the received bytes before more infrastructure is built, rather than cashing out immediately. \u00a0 \n\t___ \n\tTwo negative sides:\n \n\t- the scheme is less transparent than plain adding on top of existing balances, and some share of fraud is inevitable. \u00a0Merchants might try to deceive us to receive coins for themselves by reporting nonexistent sales or selling to themselves. \u00a0This is mitigated by good choice of trustworthy merchants and our ability to disconnect any merchant at any time on suspicion of fraud. \u00a0Their customers can also try to find ways to abuse the system, again we'll require the merchants to prevent that by excluding some types of purchases, monitoring customers, enforcing caps, etc. \u00a0Additionally, if the merchant funds part of the cashback himself, he has skin in the game to counter the customer fraud. \n\t- these new users are not holders for the most part, they are more likely to sell. \u00a0Not a big problem, the point is they already know about Byteball and it's easy for them to get back. \u00a0The new users are new to crypto, many of them won't use exchanges, and somebody will have to create new easier-to-use channels to fiat, which is positive for liquidity. \u00a0Also, 10%-20% monthly distributions discourage fast selling while the distribution is ongoing. \u00a0And lastly, the merchants who fund 50% of the cashback would partially balance the markets by buying coins. \n\t___ \n\tOn balance, I'm sure that these negatives are tolerable when we are going to achieve a vast expansion of our user base and acceptance at merchants. \n\t___ \n\tFor the current distribution round, nothing changes. \n\t___ \n\tFor the next distribution on September 6, we are changing the ratios in favor of Byte holders and slowing down the distribution to have more time to build out the cashback program: \n\t___ : every 160 BTC gives you 1 GB from the distribution (or 0.00625 GB per BTC). : every 10 GB of existing balance gives you additional 1 GB from the distribution (in other words, +10% to existing balances). \n\t___ \n\tSimilar ratios for blackbytes. \n\t___ \n\tFor those who receive their first bytes from cashbacks, Sep 6 will be the first distribution when they receive +10%. \n\t___ \n\tI'll make announcements as we add merchants in the cashback program. \n\t___ :  \n\tDistribution of bytes is complete. \n\t160,424.226385661 GB distributed in this round ($56m at the current prices). \n\t526,327.234762955 GB is the new available supply, which is 52.6% of the total supply. \u00a0Coinmarketcap is already updated. \n\t___ \n\tDistribution of blackbytes will take roughly 3 days, I'll update you when it is finished. \n\t___\n \n\tDistribution of blackbytes is now finished too. \n\t___ \n\tAs already announced, we'll now distribute bytes between rounds as cashback for purchases at participating merchants  \n\t___ \n\tDistribution on top of existing balances in Bytes and BTC continues too. \u00a0The next round is on the Full Moon of September ( ):  1 BTC of proven balance gives you 6.25 MB (0.00625 GB)  1 BTC of proven balance gives you 2.1111 * 6.25 million blackbytes (money supply of blackbytes is 2.1111 times more than that of bytes)  1 byte on   Byteball address gives you 0.1 new bytes  1 byte on   Byteball address gives you 0.21111 blackbytes \n\t___ \n\tPutting this another way, to receive 1 GB from the distribution, you need to already hold 160 BTC or 10 GB. \u00a0These same holdings also give you 2.1111 GBB (giga-blackbyte). \n\t___ \n\tWatch our announcements to learn about merchants who join the cashback program (contact me if

Since the fees paid are returned into the circulation, the money supply will remain the same. \n\tIn Byteball, there is a protocol rule that a transaction must include the previous transaction (if any) sent from the same address, i.e. there must be partial order between subsequent transactions from the same address.\u00a0 Breaking this rule is considered equivalent to double-spending, therefore at least one of such unordered transactions will become void.\u00a0 If we assume that most witnesses follow this rule (that\u2019s what they are elected for), they have to reference only sufficiently recent transactions as parents and can\u2019t inherit from old enough parents.\u00a0 Therefore, they can no longer influence the MC (which is attracted to witnesses) in the old enough part of the DAG, and that part of the MC becomes stable, hence the total order relative to this MC also becomes stable.\u00a0 See the white paper for discussion of exact criteria of reaching stability, here it is important that the criteria are deterministic, and once a transaction appears on the stable part of the MC, it is final, and, unlike all other cryptocurrencies, no re-orgs are possible. \u00a0 \n\tThis is extremely important for applications in financial industry and for wider adoption in general, as most people are used to expect certainty in matters of money and property ownership, and the concept of probabilistic finality is a difficult sell. \n\tBytes is the native currency of Byteball.\u00a0 Users can issue any other tokens (assets), e.g. to represent debt.\u00a0 The debt can be expressed e.g. in fiat currencies or in natural units (barrels, ounces, kWh, etc).\u00a0 The issuers of the debt can reveal their real-world identities and/or be voluntarily attested (i.e. their real-word identities be verified by a well known third party such as CA).\u00a0 This enables the use of the existing legal system to secure against fraud. \n\tThe issued assets can be used as means of payment, along with bytes.\u00a0 Assets can be exchanged against bytes and other assets by both parties signing a single unit that executes both legs of the exchange, thus the two transactions either happen simultaneously or don't happen at all.\u00a0 This kind of signing is called multilateral signing.\u00a0 No centralized exchange is needed, hence no trust is necessary and no exchange fees (apart from the usual fees for the size of the data). \n\tAssets can be either public or private.\u00a0 All transactions in public assets are visible to everyone on the public decentralized database, just like Bitcoin.\u00a0 Bytes is a predefined public asset. \n\tPayments in private assets are not published to the public database.\u00a0 Instead, only the hash of the transaction is stored to the database, while the plaintext of the transaction is sent directly from the payer to the payee.\u00a0 To protect against double-spends, a   is also published to the Byteball database.\u00a0 The spend proof is constructed as a hash of the output being spent, so that if the same output is spent twice, the spend proofs will be necessarily the same. \n\tI\u2019ve already described this design at  , see more details in the white paper. \n\tRegulated institutions can issue assets that are compatible with KYC/AML requirements. Every transfer of such asset is to be cosigned by the issuer, and if there is anything that contradicts the regulations, the issuer won't cosign. \n\tThis way, banks can issue fiat-pegged assets and stay fully compliant.\u00a0 They can open demand deposit accounts and track them on Byteball as assets.\u00a0 These assets are easily exchangeable against bytes and other assets (with bank\u2019s approval). \n\t- Spending conditions (AKA smart contracts) in an easy to understand declarative language  \n\t- Multisig: a special case of spending conditions \n\t- On-chain oracles can post data (such as timestamps, exchange rates, weather, various events) directly to the database, then that data can be referenced from spending conditions \n\t- Private end-to-end encrypted messaging: used to convey private payment data, communicate in multisig scenarios, and chat with a merchant\u2019s bot. \n\tThere will be no ICO, no crowdsale.\u00a0 I believe the success of a currency depends on the number of people who own it, in fact Peter R\u2019s research suggests that historical marketcap of Bitcoin follows  :  , i.e. it is proportional to the square of the number of active users.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I want Byteball to be in the hands of as many people as possible: \n\t- 98% of all bytes and blackbytes (the private untraceable currency) will be distributed among bitcoin holders who link their bitcoin and byteball addresses before any of the distribution rounds.\u00a0 No investment required, you keep your bitcoins, plus receive the bytes and blackbytes.\u00a0 See below how to receive the coins. \n\t- 1% I reserve for myself \n\tThe network was launched on December 25, 2016, and 10% of bytes and blackbytes distributed to those who linked their Bitcoin and Byteball addresses.\u00a0 The total balance linked was over 70,000 BTC. \n\tIf you missed the 1st round of distribution, you can still participate in the further rounds.\u00a0 If you were in the 1st round, you can multiply your holdings.\u00a0 In the second round, which is expected in mid-February, you receive: \n\t- 62.5 MB for every 1 BTC of proven balance \n\t- 0.1 new bytes for every 1 byte (received in the 1st round) \n\tTo participate, link your Byteball and Bitcoin addresses before the second round: \n\t1.\u00a0 Download and install the wallet by following the above links. \n\t2.\u00a0 Visit   and click the link to chat with the Transition Bot.\u00a0 The link will open the new wallet and start a chat.\u00a0 Follow the instructions of the Transition Bot to prove your Bitcoin balance.\n \n\t \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tYou have two options to prove your Bitcoin balance: \n\ta.\u00a0 By making a micropayment.\u00a0 The bot will see your address the payment came from, will know that it is your address, and will instruct you to move your Bitcoins to this address.\u00a0 By making several micropayments, you can link several Bitcoin addresses to the same Byteball address. \n\tb.\u00a0 By signing a message (if your Bitcoin wallet supports this function).\u00a0 You tell the bot your Bitcoin address and sign your Byteball address with the Bitcoin address.\u00a0 After you prove one address (a typical Bitcoin wallet has dozens of them), you can either move all your coins to this single proven address or prove all other addresses in the same way -- by signing a message. \u00a0 \n\tIf you try to link the same Bitcoin address to multiple Byteball addresses, both links are ignored.\u00a0 If you did this by mistake, link another Bitcoin address. \n\tIf you prove by micropayment, remember to check that the Bitcoin address that the bot received the micropayment from, is indeed your address.\u00a0 An attacker might see your payment on the blockchain and repeat the same micropayment from his address trying to trick you to move your funds to him. \n\t3.\u00a0 If you make any Bitcoin payment, your coins will most likely be moved to a new change address.\u00a0 Chat with the bot again, see the balance on your linked address(es) and move the coins back to the linked address(es) if necessary. \n\tThe linking phase will end in mid February (exact date to be announced later), after which we'll do the distribution in proportion to BTC and bytes balances on the distribution date. \n\tIn the second round, we'll distribute as much as is linked and calculated by the above rules, the exact % is not known in advance. \u00a0 \n\tThe 3rd and subsequent rounds (yet to be announced) will follow similar rules, but the relative weight of bytes vs. BTC in the 3rd and further rounds will change and will gradually increase to 1 BTC=62.5 MB.\u00a0 It will be selected to maximize the value of bytes and keep the speed of distribution in sync with the growth of user base and the actual use of the network.\u00a0 The ratio 62.5 MB per 1 BTC is chosen so that the total money supply of bytes (10 ) and the total number of BTC in circulation (16,000,000) are equivalent. \n\tWe'll have as many rounds as is necessary until all bytes are distributed, the rounds will be spaced 1 to 2 months. \n\tEarlier adopters have the opportunity to participate in greater number of distribution rounds and receive new bytes in each round by using the same BTC balance and bytes received in the previous rounds.\u00a0 You are effectively multiplying your stake in each additional round you take part in. \n\t- play with the wallets, install them on multiple devices, pair them for multisig.\u00a0 If you find bugs, report them. \n\t- run a relay on your cloud server to help the network. The relay doesn\u2019t hold any private keys, so you don\u2019t have to worry too much about security.\u00a0 Get relay source code from  \n\t- run a hub to better decentralize the delivery of private payments (the hub also includes a relay).\u00a0 Again, the security doesn\u2019t matter much as all messages are end-to-end encrypted.\u00a0 Hub address can be changed by users in their wallet settings.\u00a0 Get hub source code from  \n\t- fix bugs, contribute improvements in our github repositories  In particular, we need faster syncing and faster UI.\u00a0 Before now, I prioritized simplicity of algorithms over performance, now we need speed too.\u00a0 A 10x improvement should come easy enough, the next 10x will be probably harder.\u00a0 Discuss any major changes before actually implementing them. \n\t- develop new tools/apps that you think will be useful for Byteball users \n\t- spread the word about Byteball and remember that its value is proportional to the square of the number of active users \n\tTranslations:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  . \n\tTwitter:  \n\tSlack:  \n\tTelegram:  \n\tQQ: 326176030 \n\t----------------------------- \n\tOne last thing.\u00a0 The remaining 1% will be given away to the first 100m users who install Byteball wallet, 100 Kbytes to each user.\u00a0 This will start 6 months from now or later, after we get ready for that scale.\n \n\t\u00a0\n", "postAuthor": "vindyne8", "postDate": "11/17/2016 01:08  AM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Legendary Member", "authorPostCount": "16", "postLikes": 0},

Those that relay the activity and transactions get rewarded some bytes? I read the whitepaper but still am looking for some sort of understanding of this. It is not a proof-of. \n \n\t Why it is not instant? say if there are 1000 tx per second in the network, my transaction once done will be covered within a second by 50 other transactions, isn't that after 1 second my transaction will have 50 confirmations? If we put 10 confirmations as confirmed, isn't my tx is confirmed after less than 1 sec? Perhaps you got used to hear about N confirmations in Bitcoin.\u00a0 There is no such thing here, your transaction is either final or not.\u00a0 And getting covered advances it to being final.\u00a0 Getting covered by witnesses matters most (the structure of the DAG after your transaction also matters for finality).\u00a0 Witnesses earn fees from transactions they cover, and the more transactions per second there are in the network, the more frequently witnesses will post with positive ROI (they pay fees like everybody else).\n \n\tYou will never get sub-second confirmation times because of network latency. \n\t-tonych \n\t OK so if I got it correctly, then if the transaction are covered by more than half witnesses' transactions it will be final thus confirmed? Are witnesses always emit transactions? What if none of the witness are doing tx? my tx will never get confirmed? It'll do as a very rough approximation, see the white paper for the exact criteria of finality. \n \n\t This is interesting question. Suppose, each of 12 witnesses run a script which submit transactions at crazy rate, but nobody else is using the network at this time. What happens then? Do witnesses end up loosing money? Witnesses do post transactions automatically but do it in a bit more reasonable way  \n \n\t is there any way planned to increase marketing apart from the sig campaign ?\n \n\tI think this project will only succeed if we have a lot of users. \n\t Quick Question; can we link multiple BTC addresses to our one Byteball address by sending the micro transaction from each BTC address, and do we have to run the Transition Bot each time? You can (if you can control which address the payment is sent from, this is an advanced feature).\u00a0 You just send the same micro-amount to the same address. \n \n\t Incidentally, I finished developing our trustless exchange bot a day ago, just when you started this discussion.\u00a0 How did you know? Please provide some more details? how to use it? what internal assets you meant? Is it blackbyte? I don't see any other internal assets... I'll release it in a few days, need to make a few changes to the wallet too. \n Any suggestions are welcome. \n \n", "postAuthor": "vindyne8", "postDate": "12/18/2016 03:56  PM", "quotedText": "Hi tonych,", "authorRep": "Legendary Member", "authorPostCount": "16", "postLikes": 0},

Since the fees paid are returned into the circulation, the money supply will remain the same. \n\tIn Byteball, there is a protocol rule that a transaction must include the previous transaction (if any) sent from the same address, i.e. there must be partial order between subsequent transactions from the same address.\u00a0 Breaking this rule is considered equivalent to double-spending, therefore at least one of such unordered transactions will become void.\u00a0 If we assume that most witnesses follow this rule (that\u2019s what they are elected for), they have to reference only sufficiently recent transactions as parents and can\u2019t inherit from old enough parents.\u00a0 Therefore, they can no longer influence the MC (which is attracted to witnesses) in the old enough part of the DAG, and that part of the MC becomes stable, hence the total order relative to this MC also becomes stable.\u00a0 See the white paper for discussion of exact criteria of reaching stability, here it is important that the criteria are deterministic, and once a transaction appears on the stable part of the MC, it is final, and, unlike all other cryptocurrencies, no re-orgs are possible. \u00a0 \n\tThis is extremely important for applications in financial industry and for wider adoption in general, as most people are used to expect certainty in matters of money and property ownership, and the concept of probabilistic finality is a difficult sell. \n\tBytes is the native currency of Byteball.\u00a0 Users can issue any other tokens (assets), e.g. to represent debt.\u00a0 The debt can be expressed e.g. in fiat currencies or in natural units (barrels, ounces, kWh, etc).\u00a0 The issuers of the debt can reveal their real-world identities and/or be voluntarily attested (i.e. their real-word identities be verified by a well known third party such as CA).\u00a0 This enables the use of the existing legal system to secure against fraud. \n\tThe issued assets can be used as means of payment, along with bytes.\u00a0 Assets can be exchanged against bytes and other assets by both parties signing a single unit that executes both legs of the exchange, thus the two transactions either happen simultaneously or don't happen at all.\u00a0 This kind of signing is called multilateral signing.\u00a0 No centralized exchange is needed, hence no trust is necessary and no exchange fees (apart from the usual fees for the size of the data). \n\tAssets can be either public or private.\u00a0 All transactions in public assets are visible to everyone on the public decentralized database, just like Bitcoin.\u00a0 Bytes is a predefined public asset. \n\tPayments in private assets are not published to the public database.\u00a0 Instead, only the hash of the transaction is stored to the database, while the plaintext of the transaction is sent directly from the payer to the payee.\u00a0 To protect against double-spends, a   is also published to the Byteball database.\u00a0 The spend proof is constructed as a hash of the output being spent, so that if the same output is spent twice, the spend proofs will be necessarily the same. \n\tI\u2019ve already described this design at  , see more details in the white paper. \n\tRegulated institutions can issue assets that are compatible with KYC/AML requirements. Every transfer of such asset is to be cosigned by the issuer, and if there is anything that contradicts the regulations, the issuer won't cosign. \n\tThis way, banks can issue fiat-pegged assets and stay fully compliant.\u00a0 They can open demand deposit accounts and track them on Byteball as assets.\u00a0 These assets are easily exchangeable against bytes and other assets (with bank\u2019s approval). \n\t- Spending conditions (AKA smart contracts) in an easy to understand declarative language  \n\t- Multisig: a special case of spending conditions \n\t- On-chain oracles can post data (such as timestamps, exchange rates, weather, various events) directly to the database, then that data can be referenced from spending conditions \n\t- Private end-to-end encrypted messaging: used to convey private payment data, communicate in multisig scenarios, and chat with a merchant\u2019s bot. \n\tThere will be no ICO, no crowdsale.\u00a0 I believe the success of a currency depends on the number of people who own it, in fact Peter R\u2019s research suggests that historical marketcap of Bitcoin follows  :  , i.e. it is proportional to the square of the number of active users.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I want Byteball to be in the hands of as many people as possible: \n\t- 98% of all bytes and blackbytes (the private untraceable currency) will be distributed among bitcoin holders who link their bitcoin and byteball addresses before any of the distribution rounds.\u00a0 No investment required, you keep your bitcoins, plus receive the bytes and blackbytes.\u00a0 See below how to receive the coins. \n\t- 1% I reserve for myself \n\tThe network was launched on December 25, 2016, and 10% of bytes and blackbytes distributed to those who linked their Bitcoin and Byteball addresses.\u00a0 The total balance linked was over 70,000 BTC. \n\tIf you missed the 1st round of distribution, you can still participate in the further rounds.\u00a0 If you were in the 1st round, you can multiply your holdings.\u00a0 In the second round, which is expected in mid-February, you receive: \n\t- 62.5 MB for every 1 BTC of proven balance \n\t- 0.1 new bytes for every 1 byte (received in the 1st round) \n\tTo participate, link your Byteball and Bitcoin addresses before the second round: \n\t1.\u00a0 Download and install the wallet by following the above links. \n\t2.\u00a0 Visit   and click the link to chat with the Transition Bot.\u00a0 The link will open the new wallet and start a chat.\u00a0 Follow the instructions of the Transition Bot to prove your Bitcoin balance.\n \n\t \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tYou have two options to prove your Bitcoin balance: \n\ta.\u00a0 By making a micropayment.\u00a0 The bot will see your address the payment came from, will know that it is your address, and will instruct you to move your Bitcoins to this address.\u00a0 By making several micropayments, you can link several Bitcoin addresses to the same Byteball address. \n\tb.\u00a0 By signing a message (if your Bitcoin wallet supports this function).\u00a0 You tell the bot your Bitcoin address and sign your Byteball address with the Bitcoin address.\u00a0 After you prove one address (a typical Bitcoin wallet has dozens of them), you can either move all your coins to this single proven address or prove all other addresses in the same way -- by signing a message. \u00a0 \n\tIf you try to link the same Bitcoin address to multiple Byteball addresses, both links are ignored.\u00a0 If you did this by mistake, link another Bitcoin address. \n\tIf you prove by micropayment, remember to check that the Bitcoin address that the bot received the micropayment from, is indeed your address.\u00a0 An attacker might see your payment on the blockchain and repeat the same micropayment from his address trying to trick you to move your funds to him. \n\t3.\u00a0 If you make any Bitcoin payment, your coins will most likely be moved to a new change address.\u00a0 Chat with the bot again, see the balance on your linked address(es) and move the coins back to the linked address(es) if necessary. \n\tThe linking phase will end in mid February (exact date to be announced later), after which we'll do the distribution in proportion to BTC and bytes balances on the distribution date. \n\tIn the second round, we'll distribute as much as is linked and calculated by the above rules, the exact % is not known in advance. \u00a0 \n\tThe 3rd and subsequent rounds (yet to be announced) will follow similar rules, but the relative weight of bytes vs. BTC in the 3rd and further rounds will change and will gradually increase to 1 BTC=62.5 MB.\u00a0 It will be selected to maximize the value of bytes and keep the speed of distribution in sync with the growth of user base and the actual use of the network.\u00a0 The ratio 62.5 MB per 1 BTC is chosen so that the total money supply of bytes (10 ) and the total number of BTC in circulation (16,000,000) are equivalent. \n\tWe'll have as many rounds as is necessary until all bytes are distributed, the rounds will be spaced 1 to 2 months. \n\tEarlier adopters have the opportunity to participate in greater number of distribution rounds and receive new bytes in each round by using the same BTC balance and bytes received in the previous rounds.\u00a0 You are effectively multiplying your stake in each additional round you take part in. \n\t- play with the wallets, install them on multiple devices, pair them for multisig.\u00a0 If you find bugs, report them. \n\t- run a relay on your cloud server to help the network. The relay doesn\u2019t hold any private keys, so you don\u2019t have to worry too much about security.\u00a0 Get relay source code from  \n\t- run a hub to better decentralize the delivery of private payments (the hub also includes a relay).\u00a0 Again, the security doesn\u2019t matter much as all messages are end-to-end encrypted.\u00a0 Hub address can be changed by users in their wallet settings.\u00a0 Get hub source code from  \n\t- fix bugs, contribute improvements in our github repositories  In particular, we need faster syncing and faster UI.\u00a0 Before now, I prioritized simplicity of algorithms over performance, now we need speed too.\u00a0 A 10x improvement should come easy enough, the next 10x will be probably harder.\u00a0 Discuss any major changes before actually implementing them. \n\t- develop new tools/apps that you think will be useful for Byteball users \n\t- spread the word about Byteball and remember that its value is proportional to the square of the number of active users \n\tTranslations:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  . \n\tTwitter:  \n\tSlack:  \n\tTelegram:  \n\tQQ: 326176030 \n\t----------------------------- \n\tOne last thing.\u00a0 The remaining 1% will be given away to the first 100m users who install Byteball wallet, 100 Kbytes to each user.\u00a0 This will start 6 months from now or later, after we get ready for that scale.\n \n\t\u00a0\n", "postAuthor": "vindyne8", "postDate": "11/17/2016 01:08  AM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Legendary Member", "authorPostCount": "16", "postLikes": 0},

Those that relay the activity and transactions get rewarded some bytes? I read the whitepaper but still am looking for some sort of understanding of this. It is not a proof-of. \n \n\t Why it is not instant? say if there are 1000 tx per second in the network, my transaction once done will be covered within a second by 50 other transactions, isn't that after 1 second my transaction will have 50 confirmations? If we put 10 confirmations as confirmed, isn't my tx is confirmed after less than 1 sec? Perhaps you got used to hear about N confirmations in Bitcoin.\u00a0 There is no such thing here, your transaction is either final or not.\u00a0 And getting covered advances it to being final.\u00a0 Getting covered by witnesses matters most (the structure of the DAG after your transaction also matters for finality).\u00a0 Witnesses earn fees from transactions they cover, and the more transactions per second there are in the network, the more frequently witnesses will post with positive ROI (they pay fees like everybody else).\n \n\tYou will never get sub-second confirmation times because of network latency. \n\t-tonych \n\t OK so if I got it correctly, then if the transaction are covered by more than half witnesses' transactions it will be final thus confirmed? Are witnesses always emit transactions? What if none of the witness are doing tx? my tx will never get confirmed? It'll do as a very rough approximation, see the white paper for the exact criteria of finality. \n \n\t This is interesting question. Suppose, each of 12 witnesses run a script which submit transactions at crazy rate, but nobody else is using the network at this time. What happens then? Do witnesses end up loosing money? Witnesses do post transactions automatically but do it in a bit more reasonable way  \n \n\t is there any way planned to increase marketing apart from the sig campaign ?\n \n\tI think this project will only succeed if we have a lot of users. \n\t Quick Question; can we link multiple BTC addresses to our one Byteball address by sending the micro transaction from each BTC address, and do we have to run the Transition Bot each time? You can (if you can control which address the payment is sent from, this is an advanced feature).\u00a0 You just send the same micro-amount to the same address. \n \n\t Incidentally, I finished developing our trustless exchange bot a day ago, just when you started this discussion.\u00a0 How did you know?

Alice wants solar panels that cost $20k and only has $5k to allocate towards them. \u00a0Traditionally she would have to go to a lending institutions (bank) and apply for a debt-based instrument (loan) which results in the bank actually owning the solar panels and Alice owing the bank. \u00a0Since solar panels generate revenue, there is no need for debt-instruments since investors can profit from this opportunity without Alice having to owe any third-party (financially). \u00a0Instead, Alice can crowdfund the remaining 75% (or $15,000) from investors all over the world. \u00a0If the full amount needed ($20k) is not raised in the set time-interval (typically 30 days) then all funds are returned via the smart contract to investors. \u00a0If the funding goal is reached then the raised capital is automatically sent to the hardware installer/manufacturer which eliminates the risk of Alice misusing the funds. \u00a0Once installed, the Solar panels are connected to the MyBit platform via an oracle that pulls usage and payment data from the hardware so everything is transparent and can easily be tracked and audited by investors and third-parties. \u00a0When the solar panels generate revenue (in this case feed-in tariffs or selling back to the grid) investors receive a portion of the profits proportionate to their ownership stake. \u00a0Operational and maintainence costs can either be priced into the initial funding target or be deducted from revenue as a percentage.\n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\t\t : All of the following use cases involve partnering with an IoT hardware provider to integrate MyBit which prevents our open-source application from being successfully cloned and brought to market under a different brand. \u00a0\n\t \n\t\t- Renewable Energy: To accelerate adoption of the decentralized energy grid, land and homeowners can crowdfund ownership of the solar panels. \u00a0Investors in return receive profit sharing from feed-in tariffs and excess energy production sold back to the grid (or p2p in the future). \u00a0\n\t \n\t\t- Smart Property: Smart Locks can be installed on existing brick and mortar properties or be integrated into the design of new properties so govern rent/lease payment. \u00a0If payment is not made, then the space is locked and only the owners who control the other keys can open it until payment is made. \u00a0This enables property both commercial and residential to be crowdfunded and revenue to automatically be distributed to investors without a third-party payment processing/management company involved.\n\t \n\t\t- 3d Printers: We envision 3d printers to become widespread over the next decade throughout malls, shops, and other venues. \u00a0Under the 3d-printing as a service model, investors can crowdfund these assets and be paid on a per usage basis.\n\t \n\t\t- Drones: Drones will have a major role in many commercial use cases, but we believe delivery and transport of goods will be one of the core areas that will come to market first. \u00a0People will be able to purchase stakes in these delivery drones and upon completion of each delivery they will receive revenue sharing. \u00a0As different models for monetizing drones take shape, MyBit will be flexible to integrate into any that are economical for the network.\n\t \n\t\t- Cryptocurrency ATMs: To stimulate the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, ease of access is a core component. \u00a0By crowdfunding ATM ownership it enables exponentially more units to be installed and operational across the globe. \u00a0Investors will make money off of the spread and usage fees for transacting.\n\t \n\t\t- Self-Driving Vehicles (Consumer): Self-driving cars are going to displace a lot of jobs. \u00a0We find it vital that the average person has the option to partake in the ownership and revenue sharing of these vehicles instead of centralized financing institutions controlling every aspect.\n\t \n\t\t- Automated Machinery (Commercial): Farming machinery, construction, delivery, etc. can all leverage MyBit. \u00a0It is beneficial to companies that want to upgrade machinery and infrastructure to utilize MyBit to reduce costs to enter into this market. \u00a0Simultaneously, it unlocks billions of dollars in stable investment opportunities to investors.\n\t \n\t\t- Smart Homes IoT Devices / Machine as a Service (Business Model): This will definitely take time to implement, but we at MyBit predict a disruptive transformation into micro-economies and vast adoption of micro-payments. \u00a0In this scenario, the financing model is turned upside down. \u00a0Instead of purchasing a device to use limitlessly (traditional \u2013 how it is now for the most part) , devices will be free to the consumer (crowdfunded by investors), and they will pay per usage. \u00a0A major barrier to entry with this is insurance and accountability for assets.\n\t \n\t\t \u00a0\n\t \n\t\tSee section 3 of the white paper:  \n\t

Any asset whose usage can be automatically monitored is a potential use case. The proliferation of microprocessors in everyday items (think IoT) will enable the explosion of revenue generating assets and the explosion of growth of the MyBit platform.\n \n\tThe positive societal impact to individuals previously excluded from economic opportunities due to geography (proximity to a lending institution) or ability to meet minimum investment requirements (think net worth, investor sophistication, etc,..) will disproportionately propel the accelerated adoption of the MyBit solution.\n \n\t \n \n\tWith the forthcoming increase in electricity demand resulting from the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence in the areas of transportation and robotics, utility companies are exploring ways to scale the production of electricity outside their high cost traditional power generation facilities. Microgrids?\u2014?small, decentralized solar energy production units?\u2014?are a key component of their solution strategy.\n \n\tGiven there is no platform to securely connect small investors and individuals who wish to participate in the creation of microgrids (revenue generating assets) and sell the power production to the utility companies, the masses are left on the sidelines.\n \n\t \n \n\tBy commoditizing solar power systems and other forms of renewable energy, investors and landowners can crowdfund the coming decentralized energy grid and share in the corresponding revenue streams. Utility companies benefit since the new power generated will ride atop existing distribution lines and requires no material capital expansion expense. It is a win for investors, a win for private entrepreneurs, a win for the utility companies, and a significant win for the environment.\n \n\tMyBit connects investors from around the world with businesses and individuals seeking to fund revenue generating assets like microgrids. The MyBit platform gives investors security on their investment, while landowners get access to investors willing to help in exchange for profit. By standardizing and automating setup, sales, and dividends, Mybit takes us step closer to an equitable economy.\n \n\t \n \n\tBrave New Coin will manage escrow and releasing funds through a multi-signature wallet contract stored on Ethereum.\n \n\t \n \n\t : 30 Days or until maximum amount reached\n \n\t : MyB\n \n\t : 7.000.000 MyB\n \n\t : 2.000 Ether\n \n\t : 44.875 Ether\n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\tWeek 1:   \u2014 0,0075eth/MyB\n \n\tWeek 2:   \u2014 0,0085eth/MyB\n \n\tWeek 3:   \u2014 0,0090eth/MyB\n \n\tWeek 4: Full Price \u2014 0,01eth/MyB\n \n\t \n", "postAuthor": "vindyne8", "postDate": "06/19/2017 02:15  AM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Legendary Member", "authorPostCount": "16", "postLikes": 0},

Alice wants solar panels that cost $20k and only has $5k to allocate towards them. \u00a0Traditionally she would have to go to a lending institutions (bank) and apply for a debt-based instrument (loan) which results in the bank actually owning the solar panels and Alice owing the bank. \u00a0Since solar panels generate revenue, there is no need for debt-instruments since investors can profit from this opportunity without Alice having to owe any third-party (financially). \u00a0Instead, Alice can crowdfund the remaining 75% (or $15,000) from investors all over the world. \u00a0If the full amount needed ($20k) is not raised in the set time-interval (typically 30 days) then all funds are returned via the smart contract to investors. \u00a0If the funding goal is reached then the raised capital is automatically sent to the hardware installer/manufacturer which eliminates the risk of Alice misusing the funds. \u00a0Once installed, the Solar panels are connected to the MyBit platform via an oracle that pulls usage and payment data from the hardware so everything is transparent and can easily be tracked and audited by investors and third-parties. \u00a0When the solar panels generate revenue (in this case feed-in tariffs or selling back to the grid) investors receive a portion of the profits proportionate to their ownership stake. \u00a0Operational and maintainence costs can either be priced into the initial funding target or be deducted from revenue as a percentage.\n \n\t \n \n\t : All of the following use cases involve partnering with an IoT hardware provider to integrate MyBit which prevents our open-source application from being successfully cloned and brought to market under a different brand. \u00a0\n \n\t- Renewable Energy: To accelerate adoption of the decentralized energy grid, land and homeowners can crowdfund ownership of the solar panels. \u00a0Investors in return receive profit sharing from feed-in tariffs and excess energy production sold back to the grid (or p2p in the future). \u00a0\n \n\t- Smart Property: Smart Locks can be installed on existing brick and mortar properties or be integrated into the design of new properties so govern rent/lease payment. \u00a0If payment is not made, then the space is locked and only the owners who control the other keys can open it until payment is made. \u00a0This enables property both commercial and residential to be crowdfunded and revenue to automatically be distributed to investors without a third-party payment processing/management company involved.\n \n\t- 3d Printers: We envision 3d printers to become widespread over the next decade throughout malls, shops, and other venues. \u00a0Under the 3d-printing as a service model, investors can crowdfund these assets and be paid on a per usage basis.\n \n\t- Drones: Drones will have a major role in many commercial use cases, but we believe delivery and transport of goods will be one of the core areas that will come to market first. \u00a0People will be able to purchase stakes in these delivery drones and upon completion of each delivery they will receive revenue sharing. \u00a0As different models for monetizing drones take shape, MyBit will be flexible to integrate into any that are economical for the network.\n \n\t- Cryptocurrency ATMs: To stimulate the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, ease of access is a core component. \u00a0By crowdfunding ATM ownership it enables exponentially more units to be installed and operational across the globe. \u00a0Investors will make money off of the spread and usage fees for transacting.\n \n\t- Self-Driving Vehicles (Consumer): Self-driving cars are going to displace a lot of jobs. \u00a0We find it vital that the average person has the option to partake in the ownership and revenue sharing of these vehicles instead of centralized financing institutions controlling every aspect.\n \n\t- Automated Machinery (Commercial): Farming machinery, construction, delivery, etc. can all leverage MyBit. \u00a0It is beneficial to companies that want to upgrade machinery and infrastructure to utilize MyBit to reduce costs to enter into this market. \u00a0Simultaneously, it unlocks billions of dollars in stable investment opportunities to investors.\n \n\t- Smart Homes IoT Devices / Machine as a Service (Business Model): This will definitely take time to implement, but we at MyBit predict a disruptive transformation into micro-economies and vast adoption of micro-payments. \u00a0In this scenario, the financing model is turned upside down. \u00a0Instead of purchasing a device to use limitlessly (traditional \u2013 how it is now for the most part) , devices will be free to the consumer (crowdfunded by investors), and they will pay per usage. \u00a0A major barrier to entry with this is insurance and accountability for assets.\n \n\t \u00a0\n \n\tSee section 3 of the white paper:  \n \n\t \n \n\t \n\t \n \n\t \n\t \n \n\t \n\t :

There is no listing fee for smart contracts. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\t2. Modex will let developers choose to open source their work for peer-review and pen testing -or- select from proven auditors who they can trust. In either case, auditing and pen testing will be rewarded by MDX token bounties. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\t3. The contract will then be deployed in the store -or- to the client who commissioned the work. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\t4. Buyers will be able to purchase, using MDX tokens, the use of the smart contracts listed in the Smart Contract Marketplace. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\t___\n \n\t**Why an Initial Token Sale**: \n\t___ \n\tThe Modex team already has substantial funding and market traction in place. This is evident considering that the Moneymailme multi-currency wallet is in commercial use with a growing international user base and there is a multi-crypto currency update scheduled for release later this fall. Additionally the recently launched M3 payments gateway services is now ready for commercial use. \n\t___ \n\tModex recognized a clear market need and opportunity to bring this ecosystem together with the smart contract marketplace; building on top of our existing applications for an easy path to deployment. Moreover,it did not make sense to continue pursuing traditional venture capitalists. Token sales offer a myriad of additional benefits, for both the investor and user communities alike. \n\t___ \n\tModex\u2019s product philosophy and marketing philosophy mirror one another, as both closely track social trends. Our marketing approach is all about community engagement and empowerment, through an organized ecosystem of developer tools, consumer applications, and incentives. Given that there are a number of other great organizations who are working to address the very real liquidity challenges (e.g. Comit, Bancor, etc), that we can simply partner with, Modex can focus its efforts on the smart contract marketplace to bridge the gap between businesses, developers, and real-world users. The applications and smart contracts empowered by the Modex marketplace will increase blockchain adoption and our team has previous experience working in this space. \n\t___ \n\tWe are confident that our approach will significantly advance market adoption for smart contracts, blockchain technology, and thus cryptocurrencies alike, serving many in need around the world. \n\t___\n \n\t**Token Sale Official Website**: Visit Us At: www.modex.tech \n\t___\n \n\t**Token Sale Schedule**: \n\t___ \n\tModex Official Initial Coin Offering \u201cICO\u201d Announcement: September 8, 2017 Modex Pre-Sale: September 28th, 2017 (open to the public) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\t___ \n\tModex Pre-Sale:  \n\tModex Initial Coin Offering:  \n\t___ \n\tThe pre-sale event will be open for 12 days, starting at 9am Central European Time CET. \n\t___ \n\tModex Initial Token Offering: October. 8th 2017 \n\tThe initial coin offering will be conducted over 30 days, in 3 stages.

{"url": "https://www.cryptotalk.org/index.php?/topic/674-torcoin-official-announcement/", "postText": "\n\tANNOUNCING TORCOIN [TOR] --> THE MOST ANONYMOUS CRYPTOCURRENCY & FULLY INTEGRATED WITH THE TOR NETWORK!\u00a0\n \n\t>>>> OFFICIAL THREAD AT   <<<<<\n \n\tGITHUB >>  \n \n\tWindows QT >>  \n \n\tOFFICIAL WEBSITE:  \n \n\tBuy & Sell TorCoin: \n\t---------- \n\t@C-Cex:  \n\t@CoinExchange.io:  \n \n\tQUICK FACTS \n\t-------------------\n \n\t---> TorCoin is 100% Anonymous, unlike Bitcoin. \u00a0Send & Receive payments with full privacy \n\t---> TorCoin is fully integrated with the TOR network, thereby rewarding TOR node operators \n\t---> Send & Receive encrypted end-to-end messages to other TorCoin users \n\t---> Ultra-fast confirmation times \n\t---> X11 hashing algorithm \n\t---> Easy to mine \n\t---> Compatible with Windows, Linux, and more \n\t---> Android wallet coming soon!\n \n\tWHAT IS TORCOIN? \n\t>>> TorCoin is a cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin featuring numerous improvements and innovations, such as full integration with the TOR network, stealth sending technology, and complete anonymity.\n \n\tWHY USE TORCOIN? \n\t>>> TorCoin offers several important features that Bitcoin does not. First, TorCoin rewards people for running a TOR node. Whereas Bitcoin transactions are completely traceable, TorCoin enables you to send coins anonymously. There is never any need to 'mix' or 'anonymize' your TorCoins - they are anonymous by default. TOR is fully integrated with TorCoin, which means that a snoop or attacker watching your internet connection will not know if you are using TorCoin - and other TorCoin users cannot determine the physical location of your Torcoin node. TorCoin also offers encrypted end-to-end messaging between TorCoin users.\n \n\tHOW ANONYMOUS IS TORCOIN? \n\t>>> It is the most anonymous cryptocurrency yet developed. Because TOR is integrated with TorCoin, all TorCoin nodes are completely anonymous; no one will ever know that you are running a TorCoin node, or trace your location. TorCoin protects you by re-routing your connection to other TorCoin nodes running TOR.\n \n\tWHAT CONSENSUS ALGORITHM DOES TORCOIN USE? \n\t>>> Like Bitcoin, TorCoin uses Proof-of-Work, but unlike Bitcoin it is configured to transition to Proof-of-Stake after two years, when small numbers of coins will be issued yearly for staking. Staking will be 5% per year. The advantage of transitioning to Proof-of-Stake is to avoid the centralized mining pools that may eventually threaten Bitcoin with a 51% attack. Most Bitcoin mining has been centralized in China, which is not necessarily a good thing for the currency. Proof-of-Stake is known to discourage centralized mining pools.\n \n\tHOW MANY COINS WILL BE CREATED? \n\t>>> Twelve million coins will be created during the two-year Proof-of-Work phase, with small emissions of coins issued thereafter for staking purposes. The total number of coins will be less than Bitcoin and significantly less than Ethereum.\n \n\tIS TORCOIN A PREMINE OR INSTAMINE? \n\t>>> We created the genesis block with approximately 10% of all coins to be issued - around 1.2 million. Whether this qualifies as a 'pre-mine' is up to interpretation. Bitcoin was 'instamined' to the tune of 1 million Bitcoins, while Ethereum was 'pre-sold' in a huge crowdfunding effort at almost 20% of its total issuance. Dash was instamined for 1.9 million coins (27% of the current supply!), although its creator calls it an 'accident' rather than an 'instamine.' Call it whatever you want, but we think allocating 10% of the coins to the creator will be good for the coin for the following reasons: A. The creator has an incentive to push for the coin's success. If the creator had no coins, he may abandon the project entirely. B. The creator has an incentive and financial ability to pay a development team to continue working on the software. C. The creator has the option of 'staking' exchanges to list the coin; essentially offering them a fair amount of TorCoin to list coin on their exchange. Getting a coin listed on multiple exchanges is the key to success of the coin. D. As the coin rises in value, the creator has the financial ability to fund projects related to the expansion of the market for the coin, such as creating exchanges or funding startups.\n \n\tIS TORCOIN A SCAMCOIN OR PUMP AND DUMP? \n\t>>> No. We believe strongly in anonymity and have developed this coin to help bolster the TOR network by creating more nodes and to increase anonymity in the cryptocurrency space by enabling people to send coins anonymously. While we hope TorCoin rises in value, we are in it for the long haul with TorCoin and have no desire to dump large amounts of the coin on the market.\n \n\tWHO CREATED TORCOIN? \n\t>>> God. Aliens. Elvis Presley. Who cares? TorCoin is open-sourced and de-centralized; the creator is already irrelevant.\n \n\tTECHNICAL INFO \n\t>>> Torcoin is a hybrid cryptocurrency utilizing the X11 hashing algorithm (11 rounds of different hashing functions) with the Proof-Of-Work consensus, transitioning to Proof-Of-Stake after 2 years. Torcoin provides full Tor integration with the Tor Onion network. Stealth addresses are available for the anonymous sending of currency through the network. Encrypted messsaging is also available in Torcoin, enabling users to send encrypted messages to other Torcoin users. A total of 12 million TOR will be created before the Proof-Of-Work phase ends and Proof-Of-Stake begins. During the Proof-of-Stake phase, small emissions of coins will be issued each year for the purposes of staking. Staking will be 5% per year. Block Times in the Torcoin network occur at 60 second intervals. The Block Reward schedule is set to halve every 6 months from the start with a reward of 1 TOR per block.\n \n\tWHY USE TORCOIN?\n \n\t*** Completely Untraceable \n\tNo one will ever know you are running a TorCoin node - your real IP is never broadcast to the network because TorCoin runs over TOR.\n \n\t*** Anonymous Payments \n\tUsing stealth addresses, TorCoin payments are completely anonymous and untraceable by attackers, government agencies or anyone else.\n \n\t*** Fast Confirmation Times \n\tTorCoin provides extremely rapid confirmation times, meaning you can send and receive funds almost instantly, without the slow confirmation times of Bitcoin.\n \n\t*** Encrypted End-to-end Messaging \n\tYou can send encrypted end-to-end messages to other TorCoin users.\n \n\t*** Helping the TOR Network \n\tBy running TorCoin, you are increasing the number of nodes on the TOR network, and thereby helping people across the world remain anonymous.\n \n\tAre You Affiliated With the TOR Project? \n\t>>> Not officially, though we are huge supporters of the TOR Project.\n \n\tWhat Happened to the Original TORCOIN? \n\t>>> Your guess is as good as ours. There was a TORCOIN developed in 2013 by some graduate students; the project was soon abandoned. The original TORCOIN contained vulnerabilities and poor coding. The new TorCoin bears no resemblance to its predecessor, nor did we use any of the code from the original TorCoin. The 2013 TorCoin is still listed on CoinMarketcap, but it has zero trade volume, a market cap of 9 BTC, and completely outdated code; the project was entirely abandoned. We intend to get our new TorCoin listed and the old TorCoin fully de-listed.\n \n\tDOES TORCOIN OFFER END-TO-END ENCRYPTED MESSAGING? \n\t>>> Yes! With TorCoin, users can send encrypted end-to-end messages to other TorCoin users.\n \n\tWILL TORCOIN COMPETE WITH BITCOIN? \n\t>>> We believe Bitcoin to be the GOLD STANDARD of cryptocurrency, much like gold is - literally - the gold standard of metals. Silver, Palladium and Platinum all have value - they just don't have as much value as gold. Bitcoin is the crypto against which all other cryptos should be - and will always be - measured. TorCoin is not intended to 'compete' with Bitcoin, but TorCoin offers certain features that Bitcoin notably lacks, such as integration with TOR, encrypted end-to-end messaging between TorCoin users, untraceable payments and fast confirmation times. We hope TorCoin becomes a useful cryptocurrency for those concerned about personal privacy online. Because of its native anonymity, TorCoin offers a much better alternative than Bitcoin for many activities.\n \n\tWILL TORCOIN PROVE VULNERABLE TO 51% ATTACKS OR CENTRALIZED MINING POOLS? \n\t>>> We hope not. Because TorCoin will transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus after two years, centralization of mining will be less appealing, and 51% attacks will therefore prove more challenging. Mining centralization and the potential for 51% attacks are a major weakness of Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work consensus model, which has led to centralization of mining in China (due to bottoming electricity costs) and even the mining company Ghash.io controlling more than 51% of mining for a brief moment, sparking fears of an attack.\n \n\tWHAT SETS TORCOIN APART FROM OTHER CRYPTOS? \n\t>>> Unlike most other cryptos (excluding Monero and a few others), TorCoin offers completely anonymous sending. Apart from all other cryptos, TorCoin is fully integrated with TOR and therefore 100% anonymous; an attacker or government snoop can never see if you are running a TorCoin node or not. Your IP address is therefore never broadcast on TorCoin. Unlike Bitcoin and some of the older currencies, TorCoin offers much faster confirmation times, meaning you can send and receive funds almost instantly. TorCoin is also designed to transition to Proof-of-Stake consensus, meaning it will discourage centralized mining pools from cropping up, which is a major problem for Bitcoin and other exclusively proof-of-work currencies. TorCoin also offers encrypted end-to-end messaging between TorCoin users. And finally .. we think the name is just really cool :-)\n \n\tFUTURE DEVELOPMENT \n\t>>> The major focus on future development will be improvement of end-usability of the coin (making it easier for average people to use), smoothly transitioning to Proof of Stake (possibly incorporating Serenity/Casper), development of an Android wallet, and improving efficiency of the network online.\n \n\tIS TORCOIN OPEN SOURCE? \n\t>>> Of course.  \n", "postAuthor": "thetorcoin", "postDate": "04/13/2017 09:50  PM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Jr. Member", "authorPostCount": 0, "postLikes": 0},

Over the course of the last few years, malware infection attempts on this forum has become increasingly sophisticated. Below is a summary of infection techniques that I have encountered. With the most sophisticated attacks, common sense and\u00a0virus scans sometimes are not sufficient to ensure safety. \n\tA newbie asks for the latest wallet, or wallet that doesn't have any TX fees, or the latest/fastest miner, and the attacker posts a program with malware embedded as a response. This type of attempt usually gets spotted pretty quickly. \n\tThe attacker creates a new ANN topic and posts a malware link as the download file (or a legit one and changes it to a malware one later). \n\tThe attacker quotes a legitimate post containing a download link written by the real developer (usually the OP or a update post) and changes the link within the quote to a malware link. \n\tThe developer account (usually responsible for making the OP) is compromised and a \"mandatory update\" is posted. This usually happens with old/abandoned coins so the real developer isn't there to notice the rogue update. \n\tIn most of the cases above, the malware has little to no detections on virustotal. This is because any script kiddie can pay $30 and have their malware crypted, rendering them fully undetectable.\n \n\t \n \n\t \n\tHackers are very good at creating fake emails that look like they are legitimate (usually malware disguised as legitimate files). Either ignore such requests or independently verify that the supposed source did send the email to you. It is also good practice to at least scan the links or files with\u00a0Virustotal.\u00a0 \n\tInstall good anti-virus and anti-malware software that periodically searches for and removes threats. Make sure to keep the software updated at all times and set a scan schedule. \n\tThe forum database was compromised in 2015 which resulted in the emails associated with the accounts being dumped. You are likely already receiving some spam emails due to this. Your email provider my have decent spam filters that will block out some spam.\u00a0 \n\tAlways be careful with what kind of files you download and run, or what kind of drives you plug into your machine. Both may contain self-executing and undetectable malware. \n\tNobody is going to give you some *get-rich* Bitcoin mining software, nor is somebody going to sell you any kind of legitimately acquired goods at unreasonably low prices. Do not download and run software from unknown/random users on a machine that you actively use. Even running it inside a VM may not be safe enough. \n\tDon\u2019t visit untrusted websites and take everything you read with a small grain of salt. Hackers tend to create fake websites and pop-ups with enticing messages that are intended to lure you in and download malware. There have been a lot of phishing attacks such as: Phishing ADs on Google, fake Bitcoin wallets on iOS and Google Play stores, etc. \n\t\u00a0\n", "postAuthor": "TDKMATT", "postDate": "11/04/2016 07:45  AM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Legendary Member", "authorPostCount": "110", "postLikes": "1"},

The larger the number of periods the less reactive the SMA is to recent price moves and as such the SMA is a momentum indicator as it moves based on price swings in the underlying.\n \n\t \n \n\tThe SMA is calculated by taking the number of periods required and summing the closing the price values at the close. So if you are calculating the SMA 12 for the price at 12 PM then take the price each hour before that until 1PM - then sum them up. The next step is to divide the total by the number of periods. It is just the average price for the number of periods.\n \n\tOften simple moving averages are used in conjunction with each other to spot trend reversals and shifts in momentum.

First, TorCoin rewards people for running a TOR node. Whereas Bitcoin transactions are completely traceable, TorCoin enables you to send coins anonymously. There is never any need to 'mix' or 'anonymize' your TorCoins - they are anonymous by default. TOR is fully integrated with TorCoin, which means that a snoop or attacker watching your internet connection will not know if you are using TorCoin - and other TorCoin users cannot determine the physical location of your Torcoin node. TorCoin also offers encrypted end-to-end messaging between TorCoin users.\n \n\tHOW ANONYMOUS IS TORCOIN? \n\t>>> It is the most anonymous cryptocurrency yet developed. Because TOR is integrated with TorCoin, all TorCoin nodes are completely anonymous; no one will ever know that you are running a TorCoin node, or trace your location. TorCoin protects you by re-routing your connection to other TorCoin nodes running TOR.\n \n\tWHAT CONSENSUS ALGORITHM DOES TORCOIN USE? \n\t>>> Like Bitcoin, TorCoin uses Proof-of-Work, but unlike Bitcoin it is configured to transition to Proof-of-Stake after two years, when small numbers of coins will be issued yearly for staking. Staking will be 5% per year. The advantage of transitioning to Proof-of-Stake is to avoid the centralized mining pools that may eventually threaten Bitcoin with a 51% attack. Most Bitcoin mining has been centralized in China, which is not necessarily a good thing for the currency. Proof-of-Stake is known to discourage centralized mining pools.\n \n\tHOW MANY COINS WILL BE CREATED? \n\t>>> Twelve million coins will be created during the two-year Proof-of-Work phase, with small emissions of coins issued thereafter for staking purposes. The total number of coins will be less than Bitcoin and significantly less than Ethereum.\n \n\tIS TORCOIN A PREMINE OR INSTAMINE? \n\t>>> We created the genesis block with approximately 10% of all coins to be issued - around 1.2 million. Whether this qualifies as a 'pre-mine' is up to interpretation. Bitcoin was 'instamined' to the tune of 1 million Bitcoins, while Ethereum was 'pre-sold' in a huge crowdfunding effort at almost 20% of its total issuance. Dash was instamined for 1.9 million coins (27% of the current supply!), although its creator calls it an 'accident' rather than an 'instamine.' Call it whatever you want, but we think allocating 10% of the coins to the creator will be good for the coin for the following reasons: A. The creator has an incentive to push for the coin's success. If the creator had no coins, he may abandon the project entirely. B. The creator has an incentive and financial ability to pay a development team to continue working on the software. C. The creator has the option of 'staking' exchanges to list the coin; essentially offering them a fair amount of TorCoin to list coin on their exchange. Getting a coin listed on multiple exchanges is the key to success of the coin. D. As the coin rises in value, the creator has the financial ability to fund projects related to the expansion of the market for the coin, such as creating exchanges or funding startups.\n \n\tIS TORCOIN A SCAMCOIN OR PUMP AND DUMP? \n\t>>> No. We believe strongly in anonymity and have developed this coin to help bolster the TOR network by creating more nodes and to increase anonymity in the cryptocurrency space by enabling people to send coins anonymously. While we hope TorCoin rises in value, we are in it for the long haul with TorCoin and have no desire to dump large amounts of the coin on the market.\n \n\tWHO CREATED TORCOIN? \n\t>>> God. Aliens. Elvis Presley. Who cares? TorCoin is open-sourced and de-centralized; the creator is already irrelevant.\n \n\tTECHNICAL INFO \n\t>>> Torcoin is a hybrid cryptocurrency utilizing the X11 hashing algorithm (11 rounds of different hashing functions) with the Proof-Of-Work consensus, transitioning to Proof-Of-Stake after 2 years. Torcoin provides full Tor integration with the Tor Onion network. Stealth addresses are available for the anonymous sending of currency through the network. Encrypted messsaging is also available in Torcoin, enabling users to send encrypted messages to other Torcoin users. A total of 12 million TOR will be created before the Proof-Of-Work phase ends and Proof-Of-Stake begins. During the Proof-of-Stake phase, small emissions of coins will be issued each year for the purposes of staking. Staking will be 5% per year. Block Times in the Torcoin network occur at 60 second intervals. The Block Reward schedule is set to halve every 6 months from the start with a reward of 1 TOR per block.\n \n\tWHY USE TORCOIN?\n \n\t*** Completely Untraceable \n\tNo one will ever know you are running a TorCoin node - your real IP is never broadcast to the network because TorCoin runs over TOR.\n \n\t*** Anonymous Payments \n\tUsing stealth addresses, TorCoin payments are completely anonymous and untraceable by attackers, government agencies or anyone else.\n \n\t*** Fast Confirmation Times \n\tTorCoin provides extremely rapid confirmation times, meaning you can send and receive funds almost instantly, without the slow confirmation times of Bitcoin.\n \n\t*** Encrypted End-to-end Messaging \n\tYou can send encrypted end-to-end messages to other TorCoin users.\n \n\t*** Helping the TOR Network \n\tBy running TorCoin, you are increasing the number of nodes on the TOR network, and thereby helping people across the world remain anonymous.\n \n\tAre You Affiliated With the TOR Project? \n\t>>> Not officially, though we are huge supporters of the TOR Project.\n \n\tWhat Happened to the Original TORCOIN? \n\t>>> Your guess is as good as ours. There was a TORCOIN developed in 2013 by some graduate students; the project was soon abandoned. The original TORCOIN contained vulnerabilities and poor coding. The new TorCoin bears no resemblance to its predecessor, nor did we use any of the code from the original TorCoin. The 2013 TorCoin is still listed on CoinMarketcap, but it has zero trade volume, a market cap of 9 BTC, and completely outdated code; the project was entirely abandoned. We intend to get our new TorCoin listed and the old TorCoin fully de-listed.\n \n\tDOES TORCOIN OFFER END-TO-END ENCRYPTED MESSAGING? \n\t>>> Yes! With TorCoin, users can send encrypted end-to-end messages to other TorCoin users.\n \n\tWILL TORCOIN COMPETE WITH BITCOIN? \n\t>>> We believe Bitcoin to be the GOLD STANDARD of cryptocurrency, much like gold is - literally - the gold standard of metals. Silver, Palladium and Platinum all have value - they just don't have as much value as gold. Bitcoin is the crypto against which all other cryptos should be - and will always be - measured. TorCoin is not intended to 'compete' with Bitcoin, but TorCoin offers certain features that Bitcoin notably lacks, such as integration with TOR, encrypted end-to-end messaging between TorCoin users, untraceable payments and fast confirmation times. We hope TorCoin becomes a useful cryptocurrency for those concerned about personal privacy online. Because of its native anonymity, TorCoin offers a much better alternative than Bitcoin for many activities.\n \n\tWILL TORCOIN PROVE VULNERABLE TO 51% ATTACKS OR CENTRALIZED MINING POOLS? \n\t>>> We hope not. Because TorCoin will transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus after two years, centralization of mining will be less appealing, and 51% attacks will therefore prove more challenging. Mining centralization and the potential for 51% attacks are a major weakness of Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work consensus model, which has led to centralization of mining in China (due to bottoming electricity costs) and even the mining company Ghash.io controlling more than 51% of mining for a brief moment, sparking fears of an attack.\n \n\tWHAT SETS TORCOIN APART FROM OTHER CRYPTOS? \n\t>>> Unlike most other cryptos (excluding Monero and a few others), TorCoin offers completely anonymous sending. Apart from all other cryptos, TorCoin is fully integrated with TOR and therefore 100% anonymous; an attacker or government snoop can never see if you are running a TorCoin node or not. Your IP address is therefore never broadcast on TorCoin. Unlike Bitcoin and some of the older currencies, TorCoin offers much faster confirmation times, meaning you can send and receive funds almost instantly. TorCoin is also designed to transition to Proof-of-Stake consensus, meaning it will discourage centralized mining pools from cropping up, which is a major problem for Bitcoin and other exclusively proof-of-work currencies. TorCoin also offers encrypted end-to-end messaging between TorCoin users. And finally .. we think the name is just really cool :-)\n \n\tFUTURE DEVELOPMENT \n\t>>> The major focus on future development will be improvement of end-usability of the coin (making it easier for average people to use), smoothly transitioning to Proof of Stake (possibly incorporating Serenity/Casper), development of an Android wallet, and improving efficiency of the network online.\n \n\tIS TORCOIN OPEN SOURCE? \n\t>>> Of course.  \n", "postAuthor": "thetorcoin", "postDate": "04/13/2017 09:51  PM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Jr. Member", "authorPostCount": 0, "postLikes": 0},

Stayawhile is a distributed global network of furnished, designer apartments in major cities around the world. It is our ambition to create a new category--branded medium-term housing--and to become the global leader with hundreds of thousands of apartments across the globe. More than a portfolio of apartments, Stayawhile is an end-to-end, technology-enabled housing system designed for a generation of people who prefer to live asset-light and on their own terms. As a result, our product lends itself to a discerning, transient and often international clientele.\n \n\tLocations Open Now: New York City, Boston & Philadelphia\n \n\tLocations Coming Soon: San Francisco, Miami, Washington D.C., London, Paris & Milan\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t \n \n\t\u2022 Offers a superior and secure alternative to traditional cash-based security deposits and escrows.\n \n\t\u2022 Serves as a mechanism to facilitate cross-border payments both to our service providers and from our customers.\n \n\t\u2022 Provides a more egalitarian way for our international clientele to demonstrate their creditworthiness by eliminating many of the typical obstacles foreign nationals typically encounter when attempting to rent apartments.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t \n \n\tOnce generated, Stayabit tokens may be used by the holder in the following ways:\n \n\t\u2022 Payment*\n \n\t\u2022 Booking Priority\n \n\t\u2022 Collateral\n \n\t\u2022 Discounts\n \n\t\u2022 Voting on future expansion locations\n \n\t*All token holders must undergo credit and background checks before they may use a token to book a Stayawhile apartment.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t \n \n\tThe potential size for this housing system is enormous. Not only is there a utilitarian need for medium-term housing, but there is also an aspirational desire based upon the growing trend toward living minimally, paring down material possessions, and living nomadically. In the U.S. alone, rental apartments are a $165 billion industry. Our goal is to operate Stayawhiles in every major global city and every apartment building in the U.S. that has more than 10 units. (There are 141,405 buildings in the U.S. with 10 or more units.)\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t \n \n\tStayawhile\u2019s broad vision is to create a world with fewer borders, where our customers can move seamlessly between the ever-expanding network of Stayawhile apartments, without signing long-term leases or buying homes.

{"url": "https://www.cryptotalk.org/index.php?/topic/1092-attempted-to-dodge-controversy-by-staying-in-a-stadium-tunnel/", "postText": "\n\tAfter playing three of their first four games on the road, the Steelers are more than happy to be playing a game at Heinz Field. \n\tAnd after being at the center of a couple of controversial games, the Steelers should be glad to just line up and play without any drama. \n\tTwo weeks ago, they drew the ire of many fans when they attempted to dodge controversy by staying in a stadium tunnel at Chicago rather than being on the field for the playing of the national anthem. \n\tLast week, it was wide receiver Antonio Brown taking out his frustration on a water cooler after quarterback Ben Roethlisberger failed to see him open downfield in the second quarter of a win at Baltimore. \n\tThe Jacksonville Jaguars could be just what the doctor ordered for the Steelers. \n\tWhen the Steelers 3 1 host the Jaguars 2 2 today, they have a pretty good idea of exactly what Jacksonville wants to accomplish. \n\tThis figures to be a good old fashioned game of smash mouth football. \n\t\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what they do,\u201d said Steelers safety Mike Mitchell. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to knuckle up. They\u2019re playing vintage 1999  , 2000 with two fullbacks, three tight ends. You know it\u2019s a run. Stop it. We\u2019re up to that. We\u2019ll see what\u2019s up today .\u201d \n\tThe Jaguars don\u2019t typically mess around with outside zone stretch runs, which have caused the Steelers issues the past two weeks, but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t try it. \n\tAfter allowing more than 200 rushing yards in a 23 17 overtime loss two weeks ago at Chicago, the Steelers gave up runs of 50 and 23 yards on outside zone stretch plays last week despite limiting Baltimore to 82 rushing yards overall. \n\t\u201cThey\u2019re going to get off the bus running the outside stretch, based on what we\u2019ve done the past two weeks,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cThey have two good running backs. They can get to the edge and make cuts vertically. But they\u2019re also going to come out in their two back formations and run the ball because that\u2019s their personality.\u201d \n\tRookie Leonard Fournette, all 228 pounds of him  , and 223 pound Chris Ivory have combined for 403 rushing yards in Jacksonville\u2019s first four games. \n\tAs much as Jacksonville would like to establish its running game, the Steelers will be tempted to do the same. \n\tThe game features the league\u2019s top two pass defenses and pass rushing teams. But Jacksonville\u2019s run defense is dead last in the league  , allowing 165.5 yards per game and 5.7 yards per carry. \n\tSteelers running back Le\u2019Veon Bell had his first 100 yard game of the season last week, with 144 yards on 35 carries. Having him play well will be key against the Jaguars and help take pressure off quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. \n\t\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be on top of our game  , run and pass, whether we\u2019re protecting or throwing,\u201d said Steelers offensive coordinator Todd Haley. \u201cThis is a good defense that\u2019s very disruptive, and if you let them get going , disrupting and creating turnovers, it\u2019ll be a long day.\u201d \n\tJacksonville has thrived on turnovers, forcing 10 in four games, including five interceptions by a secondary that features cornerbacks Jalen Ramsey and A.J. Bouye. \n\tRoethlisberger hasn\u2019t had a 300 yard passing performance in 10 regular season outings and could be hard pressed to break that string in this game. He\u2019s more concerned about playing mistake free football and keeping the offense moving in rhythm. \n\t\u201cRhythm is within yourself. It\u2019s also within the conscious of offense and other guys,\u201d said Roethlisberger. \u201c There are guys on the field who you have to be in rhythm with. If we can just win football games now and then play your best football late in the season.\u201d \n\tOdds and end zones \n\tThe only Steelers player listed as either doubtful or questionale to play is right tackle Marcus Gilbert hamstring , who sat out against Baltimore. \u2026 The series is tied 11 1. \u2026 Jacksonville head coach Doug Marrone had a tryout with the Steelers in 1991 before being released in training camp. \u2026 Roethlisberger has averaged 316.5 passing yards per game with 19 touchdowns and three interceptions in his last six home games. \n\t\u00a0\n", "postAuthor": "elvafeng", "postDate": "10/08/2017 09:13  AM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Brand New", "authorPostCount": 0, "postLikes": 0},

Friendly customer service via chat and email and for the most part, most\u00a0ticket queries appear to be\u00a0attended within a 24 hour time frame if not sooner.\u00a0That's pretty much all to share\u00a0for now but for anyone looking to find out more, feel free to visit the site and check it out.\n \n\tIf you guys know of any other crypto currency casinos that are reliable and entertaining please pass on the knowledge, cheers!\n \n\tRod B.\n", "postAuthor": "RodRJB", "postDate": "05/24/2017 07:59  PM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Brand New", "authorPostCount": 0, "postLikes": 0},

Hope it helps you.\n \n\tFull article here:  \n \n\tPrivamera de Filippi,  ,  ,  \n\tBenjamin Loveluck  ,  ,  \n\tPUBLISHED ON:\u00a0  DOI:\u00a0 \n \n\t \n \n\tBitcoin is a decentralised currency and payment system that seeks to eliminate the need for trusted authorities. It relies on a peer-to-peer network and cryptographic protocols to perform the functions of traditional financial intermediaries, such as verifying transactions and preserving the integrity of the system. This article examines the political economy of Bitcoin, in light of a recent dispute that divided the Bitcoin community with regard to a seemingly simple technical issue: whether or not to increase the block size of the Bitcoin blockchain. By looking at the socio-technical constructs of Bitcoin, the article distinguishes between two distinct coordination mechanisms: governance by the infrastructure (achieved via the Bitcoin protocol) and governance of the infrastructure (managed by the community of developers and other stakeholders). It then analyses the invisible politics inherent in these two mechanisms, which together display a highly technocratic power structure. On the one hand, as an attempt to be self-governing and self-sustaining, the Bitcoin network exhibits a strong market-driven approach to social trust and coordination, which has been embedded directly into the technical protocol. On the other hand, despite being an open source project, the development and maintenance of the Bitcoin code ultimately relies on a small core of highly skilled developers who play a key role in the design of the platform.\n \n\tSince its inception in 2008, the grand ambition of the Bitcoin project has been to support direct monetary transactions among a network of peers, by creating a decentralised payment system that does not rely on any intermediaries. Its goal is to eliminate the need for trusted third parties, particularly central banks and governmental institutions, which are prone to corruption.\n \n\tRecently, the community of developers, investors and users of Bitcoin has experienced what can be regarded as an important   \u2013 a situation whereby diverging interests have run the risk of putting the whole project in jeopardy. This governance crisis is revealing of the limitations of excessive reliance on technological tools to solve issues of social coordination and economic exchange. Taking the Bitcoin project as a case study, we argue that online peer-to-peer communities involve inherently political dimensions, which cannot be dealt with purely on the basis of protocols and algorithms.\n \n\tThe first part of this paper exposes the specificities of Bitcoin, presents its underlying political economy, and traces the short history of the project from its inception to the crisis. The second part analyses the governance structure of Bitcoin, which can be understood as a two-layered construct: an   seeking to govern user behaviour via a decentralised, peer-to-peer network on the one hand, and an   designing and architecting this infrastructure on the other. We explore the challenges faced at both levels, the solutions adopted to ensure the sustainability of the system, and the unacknowledged power structures they involve. In a third part, we expose the   of Bitcoin, with regard to both the implicit assumptions embedded in the technology and the highly centralised and largely undemocratic development process it relies on. We conclude that the overall system displays a highly technocratic power structure, insofar as it is built on automated technical rules designed by a minority of experts with only limited accountability for their decisions. Finally, drawing on the wider framework of internet governance research and practice, we argue that some form of social institution may be needed to ensure accountability and to preserve the legitimacy of the system as a whole \u2013\u00a0rather than relying on technology alone.\n \n\tHistorically, money has taken many different forms. Far from being an exclusively economic tool, money is closely associated with social and political systems as a whole \u2013 which Nigel Dodd refers to as   (Dodd 2014). Indeed, money has often been presented as an instrument which can be leveraged to shape society in certain ways and as Dodd has shown, this includes powerful utopian dimensions: for sociologist Georg Simmel for instance, an ideal social order hinged upon the definition of a \u201cperfect money\u201d (Simmel, 2004). In the wake of economic crises in particular, it is not uncommon to witness the emergence of alternative money or exchange frameworks aimed at establishing different social relations between individuals \u2013 more egalitarian, or less prone to accumulation and speculation (North, 2007). On the other hand however, ideals of self-regulating markets have often sought to   money from existing social relations, resulting in a progressive \u201cdisembedding\u201d of commercial interactions from their social and cultural context (Polanyi, 2001 [1944]).\n \n\tSince it first appeared in 2009, the decentralised cryptocurrency Bitcoin has raised high hopes for its potential to reshuffle not only the institutions of banking and finance, but also more generally power relations within society. The potential consequences of this innovation, however, are profoundly ambivalent. On the one hand, Bitcoin can be presented as a neoliberal project insofar as it radicalises Friedrich Hayek\u2019s and Milton Friedman\u2019s ambition to end the monopoly of nation-states (via their central banks) on the production and distribution of money (Hayek, 1990), or as a   which aims at reducing the control of governments on the economy (De Filippi, 2014). On the other hand, it has also been framed as a solution for greater social justice, by undermining oligopolistic and anti-democratic arrangements between big capital and governments, which are seen to favour economic crises and inequalities. Both of these claims hinge on the fact that as a socio-technical assemblage, Bitcoin seems to provide a solution for \u201cgoverning without governments\u201d, which appeals to liberal sentiments both from the left and from the right. Its implicit political project can therefore be understood as effectively getting rid of politics by relying on technology.\n \n\tMore generally, distributed networks have long been associated with a redistribution of power relations, due to the elimination of single points of control. This was one of the main interpretations of the shift in telecommunications routing methods from circuit switching to packet switching in the 1960s and the later deployment of the internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) from the 1970s onwards (Abbate, 1999), as well as the adoption of the end-to-end principle \u2013 which proved to be a compelling but also partly misleading metaphor (Gillespie, 2006). The idea was that information could flow through multiple and unfiltered channels, thus circumventing any attempts at controlling or censoring it, and providing a basis for more egalitarian social relations as well as stronger privacy. In practice however, it became clear that network design is much more complex and that additional software, protocols and hardware, at various layers of the network, could (and did) provide alternate forms of re-centralisation and control and that, moreover, the internet was not structurally immune to other modes of intervention such as law and regulation (Benkler, 2016).\n \n\tHowever, there have been numerous attempts at   the network, most of which have adopted peer-to-peer architectures as opposed to client-server alternatives, with the underlying assumption that such technical solutions provide both individual freedom and \u201ca promise of equality\u201d (Agre, 2003)  . Other technologies have also been adopted in order to add features relating to user privacy for instance, which involve alternative routing methods (Dingledine, Mathewson, & Syverson, 2004) and cryptography (which predates computing, see e.g. Kahn 1996). In particular, such ideas were strongly advocated starting from the late 1980s by an informal collective of hackers, mathematicians, computer scientists and activists known as  , who saw strong cryptography as a means of achieving greater privacy and security of interpersonal communications, especially in the face of perceived excesses and abuses on the part of governmental authorities.   Indeed, all of these solutions pursue implicit or explicit goals, in terms of their social or political consequences, which can be summed up as enabling self-organised direct interactions between individuals, without relying on a third party for coordination, and also preventing any form of surveillance or coercion.\n \n\tYet cryptography is not only useful to protect the privacy of communications; it can also serve as a means to promote further decentralisation and disintermediation when combined with a peer-to-peer architecture. In 2008, a pseudonymous entity named Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper on the Cryptography Mailing list (metzdowd.com) describing the idea of a decentralised payment system relying on a distributed ledger with cryptographic primitives (Nakamoto, 2008a). One year later, a first implementation of the ideas defined in the white paper was released and the Bitcoin network was born. It introduces its own native currency (or unit of account) with a fixed supply \u2013 and whose issuance is regulated, only and exclusively, by technological means. The Bitcoin network can therefore be used to replace at least some of the key functions played by central banks and other financial institutions in modern societies: the issuance of money on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the fiduciary functions of banks and other centralised clearing houses.\n \n\tSupported by many self-proclaimed libertarians, Bitcoin is often presented as an alternative monetary system, capable of bypassing most of the state-backed financial institutions \u2013 with all of their shortcomings and vested interests which have become so obvious in the light of the financial crisis of 2008. Indeed, as opposed to traditional centralised economies, Bitcoin\u2019s monetary supply is not controlled by any central authority, but is rather defined (in advance) by the Bitcoin protocol \u2013 which precisely stipulates the total amount of bitcoins that will ever come into being (21 million) and the rate at which they will be issued over time. A certain number of bitcoins are generated, on average, every ten minutes and assigned as a reward to those who lend their computational resources to the Bitcoin network in order to both operate and secure the network. In this sense, Bitcoin can be said to mimic the characteristics of gold. Just as gold cannot be created out of thin air, but rather needs to be extracted from the earth (through mining), Bitcoin also requires a particular kind of computational effort \u2013 also known as   \u2013 in order for the network protocol to generate new bitcoins (and just as gold progressively becomes harder to find as the stock gets depleted over, also the amount of bitcoins generated through mining decreases over time).\n \n\tThe establishment and maintenance of a currency has traditionally been regarded as a key prerogative of the State, as well as a central institution of democratic societies. Controlling the money supply, by different means, is one of the main instruments that can be leveraged in order to shape the economy, both domestically and in the context of international trade. Yet, regardless of whether one believes that the State has the right (or duty) to intervene in order to regulate the market economy, monetary policies have sometimes been instrumentalised by certain governments using inflation as a means to finance government spending (e.g. in the case of the Argentine great depression of 1998-2002). Perhaps most critical is the fact that, with the introduction of fractional-reserve banking, commercial banks acquired the ability to (temporarily) increase the money supply by giving out loans which are not backed up by actual funds (Ferguson, 2008).   The fractional-reserve banking system (and the tendency of commercial banks to create money at unsustainable rates) is believed to be one of the main factors leading to the global financial crisis of 2008 \u2013 which has brought the issue of private money issuance back into the public debate (Quinn, 2009).\n \n\tAlthough there have been many attempts at establishing alternative currencies, and cryptocurrencies have also been debated for a long time, the creation of the Bitcoin network was in large part motivated in response to the social and cultural contingencies that emerged during the global financial crisis of 2008. As explicitly stated by Satoshi Nakamoto in various blog posts and forums, Bitcoin aimed at eradicating corruption from the realm of currency issuance and exchange. Given that governments and central banks could no longer be trusted to secure the value of fiat currency and other financial instruments, Bitcoin was designed to operate as a   technology, which only relies on maths and cryptography.   The paradox being that this     is precisely what is needed for building a new form of \u201cdistributed trust\u201d (Mallard, M\u00e9adel, & Musiani, 2014).\n \n\tTrust management is a classic issue in peer-to-peer computing, and can be understood as   especially by preventing malicious operations and collusion schemes (Zhu, Jajodia, & Kankanhalli, 2006). To address this issue, Bitcoin has brought two fundamental innovations, which, together, provide for the   and   of the network. The first innovation is the  , which relies on public-private key encryption and hashing algorithms to create a decentralised, append-only and tamper-proof database. The second innovation is  , a decentralised consensus protocol using cryptography and economic incentives to encourage people to operate and simultaneously secure the network. Accordingly, the Bitcoin protocol represents an elegant, but purely technical solution to the issue of social trust \u2013 which is normally resolved by relying on trusted authorities and centralised intermediaries. With the blockchain, to the extent that trust is delegated to the technology, individuals who do not know (and therefore do not necessarily trust) each other, can now transact with one another on a peer-to-peer basis, without the need for any intermediary.\n \n\tHence Bitcoin uses cryptography not as a way to preserve the secrecy of transactions, but rather in order to create a  for financial transactions. In this context, cryptography is merely used as a discrete notational system (DuPont, 2014) designed to promote the autonomy of the system, which can operate independently of any centralised third party  . It relies on simple cryptographic primitives or building blocks (SHA256 hash functions and public-key cryptography) to resolve, in a decentralised manner, the double-spending problem   found in many virtual currencies. The scheme used by Bitcoin ( ) relies on a peer-to-peer network of validators (or  ) who commit their computational resources ( ) to the network in order to record all valid transactions into a decentralised public ledger (a.k.a. the  ) in a chronological order. All valid transactions are recorded into a block, which incorporates a reference (or  ) to the previous block \u2013 so that any attempt at tampering with the order or the content of any past transaction will always and necessarily result in an apparent discontinuity in the chain of blocks.\n \n\tBy combining a variety of existing technologies with basic cryptographic primitives, Bitcoin has created a system that is provably secure, practically incorruptible and probabilistically unattackable   \u2013 all this, without resorting to any centralised authority in charge of policing the network. Bitcoin relies on a fully open and decentralised network, designed in such a way that anyone is free to use the network and contribute to it, without the need for any kind of previous identification. Yet, contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin is neither anonymous nor privacy-friendly. Quite the contrary, anyone with a copy of the blockchain can see the history of all Bitcoin transactions. Decentralised verification requires, indeed, that every transaction be made available for validation to all nodes in the network and that every transaction ever done on the Bitcoin network can be traced back to its origin.  \n \n\tIn sum, Bitcoin embodies in its very protocols a profoundly market-driven approach to social coordination, premised on strong assumptions of rational choice (Olson, 1965) and game-theoretical principles of non-cooperation (von Neumann & Morgenstern, 1953 [1944]). The (self-)regulation of the overall system is primarily achieved through a system relying on   (the blockchain), combined with a consensus protocol and incentives mechanism (Proof-of-work), to govern the mutually adjusting interests of all involved actors. Other dimensions of social trust and coordination (such as loyalty, coercion, etc.) are seemingly expunged from a system which expressly conforms to Hayek\u2019s ideals of   organisation (Hayek, 1976, p. 107ff).\n \n\tThe history of Bitcoin \u2013 albeit very short \u2013 consists of a very intense series of events, which have led to the decentralised cryptocurrency becoming one of the most widely used forms of digital cash. The story began in October 2008, with the release of the Bitcoin white paper (Nakamoto, 2008a). In January 2009, the Bitcoin software was published and the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain was created (the so-called  ) with a release of 50 bitcoins. Shortly after, the first Bitcoin transaction took place between Satoshi Nakamoto and Hal Finney \u2013 a well-known cryptographer and prominent figure of the cypherpunk movement in the 1990s. It is not until a few months later that Bitcoin finally acquired an equivalent value in fiat currency   and slowly made its way into the commercial realm, as it started being accepted by a small number of merchants.  \n \n\tIn the early days, Satoshi Nakamoto was actively contributing to the source code and collaborating with many of the early adopters. Yet, he was always very careful to never disclose any personal details, so as to maintain his identity secret. To date, in spite of the various theories that have been put forward,   the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown. In a way, the pseudonymity of Satoshi Nakamoto perfectly mirrors that of his brainchild, Bitcoin \u2013 a technology designed to substitute technology for trust, thus rendering the identification of transacting parties unnecessary.\n \n\tOver the next few months, Bitcoin adoption continued to grow, slowly but steadily. Yet, the real spike in popularity of Bitcoin was not due to increased adoption by commercial actors, but rather to the establishment in January 2011 of   \u2013 an online marketplace (mostly used for the trading of illicit drugs) relying on Tor and Bitcoin to preserve the anonymity of buyers and sellers. Silk Road paved the way for Bitcoin to enter the mainstream, but also led many governmental agencies to raise several concerns that Bitcoin could be used to create black markets, evade taxation, facilitate money laundering and even support the financing of terrorist activities.\n \n\tIn April 2011, to the surprise of many, Satoshi Nakamoto announced on a public mailing list that he would no longer work on Bitcoin.   he said, before disappearing without further justification. Yet, before doing so, he transferred control over the source code repository of the Bitcoin client to Gavin Andresen, one of the main contributors to the Bitcoin code. Andresen, however, did not want to become the sole leader of such a project, and thus granted control over the code to four other developers \u2013 Pieter Wuille, Wladimir van der Laan, Gregory Maxwell, and Jeff Garzik. Those entrusted with these administration rights for the development of the Bitcoin project became known as the  .\n \n\tAs the popularity of Bitcoin continued to grow, so did the commercial opportunities and regulatory concerns. However, with the exit of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was left without any leading figure or institution that could speak on its behalf. This is what justified the creation, in September 2012, of the Bitcoin Foundation \u2013 an American lobbying group focused on standardising, protecting and promoting Bitcoin. With a board comprising some of the biggest names in the Bitcoin space (including Gavin Andresen himself), the Bitcoin Foundation was intended to do for Bitcoin what the Linux Foundation had done for open source software: paying developers to work full-time on the project, establishing best practices and, most importantly, bringing legitimacy and building trust in the Bitcoin ecosystem. And yet, concerns were raised regarding the legitimacy of this self-selected group of individuals \u2013 many of whom had dubious connections or were allegedly related to specific Bitcoin scams   \u2013 to act as the referent and public face of Bitcoin. Beyond the irony of having a decentralised virtual currency like Bitcoin being represented by a centralised profit-driven organisation, it soon became clear that the Bitcoin Foundation was actually unable to take on that role. Plagued by a series of financial and management issues, with some of its ex-board members under criminal investigation and most of its funds depleted, the Bitcoin Foundation has today lost much of its credibility.\n \n\tBut even the fall of the Bitcoin Foundation did not seem to significantly affect Bitcoin \u2013 probably because the Foundation was merely a   that never had the ability to effectively control the virtual currency. Bitcoin adoption has continued to grow over the past few years, to eventually reach a market capitalisation of almost US 7 billion dollars. Bitcoin still has no public face and no actual institution that can represent it. Yet, people continue to use it, to maintain its protocol, and to rely on its technical infrastructure for an increasing number of commercial (and non-commercial) operations. And although a few Bitcoin-specific regulations have been enacted thus far (see e.g. the NY State BitLicense), regulators around the world have, for the most part, refrained from regulating Bitcoin in a way that would significantly impinge upon it (De Filippi, 2014).\n \n\tBitcoin thus continues to operate, and continues to be regarded (by many) as an open source software platform that relies on a decentralised peer-to-peer network governed by distributed consensus. Yet, if one looks at the underlying reasons why Bitcoin has been created in the first place, and the ways it has eventually been adopted by different categories of people, it becomes clear that the original conception of Bitcoin as a decentralised platform for financial disruption has progressively been compromised by the social and cultural context in which the technology operates.\n \n\tFollowing the first wave of adoption by the cypherpunk community, computer geeks and crypto-libertarians, a second (larger) wave of adoption followed the advent of Silk Road in 2011. But what actually brought Bitcoin to the mainstream were the new opportunities for speculation that emerged around the cryptocurrency, as investors from all over the world started to accumulate bitcoins (either by purchasing them or by mining) with the sole purpose of generating profits through speculation. This trend is a clear reflection of the established social, economic and political order of a society driven by the capitalistic values of accumulation and profit maximisation. Accordingly, even a decentralised technology specifically designed to promote disintermediation and financial disruption can be unable to protect itself from the inherent tendencies of modern capitalist society to concentrate wealth and centralise power into the hands of a few (Kostakis & Bauwens, 2014).\n \n\tThe illusion of Bitcoin as a decentralised global network had already been challenged in the past, with the advent of large mining pools, mostly from China, which nowadays control over 75% of the network. But this is only one part of the problem. It took a simple \u2013 yet highly controversial \u2013 protocol issue to realise that, in spite of the open source nature of the Bitcoin platform, the governance of the platform itself is also highly centralised.\n \n\tTo many outside observers, the contentious issue may seem surprisingly specific. As described earlier, the blockchain underpinning the Bitcoin network is composed of a series of blocks listing the totality of transactions which have been executed so far. For a number of reasons (mainly related to preserving the security and stability of the system, as well as to ensure easy adoption), the size of these blocks was initially set at 1 megabyte. In practice, however, this technical specification also sets a restriction on the number of transactions which the blockchain can handle in a particular time frame. Hence, as the adoption of Bitcoin grew, along with the number of transactions to be processed, this arbitrary limitation (which was originally perceived as being innocuous) became the source of heated discussions \u2013 on several internet forums, blogs, and conferences \u2013 leading to an important dispute within the Bitcoin community (Rizzo, 2016). Some argued that the one megabyte cap was effectively preventing Bitcoin from scaling and was thus a crucial impediment to its growth. Others claimed that many workarounds could be found (e.g. off-chain solutions that would take off the load from the main Bitcoin blockchain) to resolve this problem without increasing the block size. They insisted that maintaining the cap was necessary both for security reasons and for   reasons, and was a precondition to keeping the system more inclusive and decentralised.\n \n\tOn 15 August 2015, failing to reach any form of consensus over the issue of block sizes, a spinoff project was proposed. Frustrated by the reluctance expressed by the other Bitcoin developers to officially raise the block size limit (Hearn, 2015), two core developers, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, released a new version of the Bitcoin client software (Bitcoin XT) with the latent capacity of accepting and producing an increased block size of eight megabytes. This client constitutes a particular kind of   of the original software or reference client (called Bitcoin Core). Bitcoin XT was released as a soft fork,   with the possibility to turn into a hard fork, if and when a particular set of conditions were met. Initially, the software would remain identical to the Bitcoin Core software, with the exception that all the blocks mined with the Bitcoin XT software would be \u201csigned\u201d by XT. This signature serves as a proxy for a poll: starting from 11 January 2016, in the event that at least 75% of all most recent 1,000 blocks have been signed by XT, the software would start accepting and producing blocks with a maximum block size of eight megabytes \u2013 with the cap increasing linearly so as to double every two years. This would mark the beginning of an actual  , leading to the emergence of two blockchain networks featuring two different and incompatible protocols.\n \n\tThe launch of Bitcoin XT proved highly controversial. It generated a considerable amount of debate among the core developers, and eventually led to a full-blown conflict which has been described as a   within the Bitcoin community (Hearn, 2016). Among the Bitcoin core developers, Gregory Maxwell in particular was a strong proponent of maintaining the 1 megabyte cap. According to him, increasing the block size cap would constitute a risky change to the fundamental rules of the system, and would inherently bring Bitcoin towards more centralisation \u2013 because it would mean that less powerful machines (such as home computers) could no longer continue to handle the blockchain, thus making the system more prone to being overrun by a small number of big computers and mining pools. Similarly, Nick Szabo \u2013 a prominent cryptographer involved since the early days in the cypherpunk community \u2013 declared that increasing the block size so rapidly would constitute a huge security risk that could jeopardise the whole network. Finally, another argument raised against the Bitcoin XT proposal was that increasing the block size would possibly lead to variable, and delayed confirmation times (as larger blocks may fail to be confirmed every ten minutes).\n \n\tWithin the broader Bitcoin community, the conflict gave rise to copious amounts of flame-wars in various online forums that represent the main sources of information for the Bitcoin community (Reddit, Bitcoin Info, Bitcoin.org, etc.). Many accused the proponents of Bitcoin XT of using populist arguments and alarmist strategies to bring people on their side. Others claimed that, by promoting a hard fork, Bitcoin XT developers were doing exactly what the Bitcoin protocol was meant to prevent: they were creating a situation whereby people from each side of the network would be able to spend the same bitcoins twice. In some cases, the conflict eventually resulted in outright censorship and banning of Bitcoin XT supporters from the most popular Bitcoin websites.   Most critically, the conflict also led to a variety of personal attacks towards Bitcoin XT proponents, and several online operators who expressed support for Bitcoin XT experienced Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.\n \n\tIn the face of these events, and given the low rate of adoption of Bitcoin XT by the Bitcoin community at large,   Mike Hearn, one of the core developers and key instigators of Bitcoin XT, decided to resign from the development of Bitcoin \u2013 which he believed was on the brink of technical collapse. Hearn condemned the emotionally charged reactions to the block size debate, and pointed at major disagreements among the appointed Bitcoin core developers in the interpretation of Nakamoto\u2019s legacy.\n \n\tBut the conflict did not end there. Bitcoin XT was only the first of a series of improvements which were subsequently proposed to the Bitcoin protocol. As Bitcoin XT failed to gain mass adoption, it was eventually abandoned on January 23rd. New suggestions were made to resolve the block size problem (see e.g., Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic, BitPay Core). The most popular today is probably Bitcoin Classic, which proposes to increase the block size cap to 2 megabytes (instead of 8) by following the same scheme as Bitcoin XT (i.e. after 75% of bitcoin miners will have endorsed the new format). One interesting aspect of Bitcoin Classic is that it also plans to set up a specific governance structure that is intended to promote more democratic decision-making with regard to code changes, by means of a voting process that will account for the opinions of the broader community of miners, users, and developers. Bitcoin Classic has received support from relevant players in the Bitcoin community, including Gavin Andresen himself, and currently accounts for 25% of the Bitcoin network\u2019s nodes.\n \n\tIt is, at this moment in time, quite difficult to predict where Bitcoin is heading. Some may think that the Bitcoin experiment has failed and that it is not going anywhere;   others may think that Bitcoin will continue to grow in underserved and inaccessible markets as a gross settlement network for payment obligations and safe haven assets;   while many others believe that Bitcoin is still heading   and that it will continue to surprise us as time goes on.   One thing is sure though: regardless of the robustness and technical viability of the Bitcoin protocol, this governance crisis and failure in conflict resolution has highlighted the fragility of the current decision-making mechanisms within the Bitcoin project. It has also emphasised the tension between the (theoretically) decentralised nature of the Bitcoin network and the highly centralised governance model that has emerged around it, which ultimately relied on the goodwill and aligned interests of only a handful of people.\n \n\tGovernance structures are set up in order to adequately pursue collective goals, maintain social order, channel interests and keep power relations under check, while ensuring the   of actions taken collectively. They are therefore closely related to the issue of  , which is a key aspect of social coordination and which online socio-technical systems address by combining informal interpersonal relations, formal rules and technical solutions in different ways (Kelty, 2005). In the case of online peer-production communities, two essential features are decisive in shaping their governance structure, namely the fact that they are   and that they seek to   (Benkler, 2006). Thus, compared to more traditional forms of organisations such as firms and corporations, they often need to implement alternative means of coordination and incentivisation (Demil & Lecocq, 2006).\n \n\tNicolas Auray has shown that, although the nature of online peer-production communities can be very different (ranging from   to   and  ), they all face three key challenges which they need to address in order to thrive (Auray, 2012):\n \n\t\t\tdefinition and protection of    ;\n\t\t \n\t\t\testablishment of   for participation and acknowledgment of the   of contributors;\n\t\t \n\t\t\tand, finally, pacification of  .\n\t\t \n\tUnderstanding how each of these challenges is addressed in the case of the Bitcoin project is particularly difficult, since Bitcoin is composed of two separate, but highly interdependent layers, which involve very different coordination mechanisms. On the one hand, there is the   layer: a decentralised payment system based on a global   peer-to-peer network which operates according to a specific set of protocols. On the other hand, there is the layer of the  : a small group of developers and software engineers who have been   with key roles for the development of this technology.\n \n\tThe Bitcoin project can thus be said to comprise at least two different types of communities \u2013 each with their own boundaries and protection mechanisms, rewards or incentive systems, and mechanisms for conflict resolution. One is the community of nodes within the network, which includes both   users merely using the network to transfer money around, and \u201cactive\u201d users (or miners) contributing their own computational resources to the networks in order to support its operations. The other is the community of developers, who are contributing code to the Bitcoin project with a view to maintain or improve its functionalities. What the crisis described above has revealed is the difficulty of establishing a governance structure which would properly interface both of these dimensions. As a consequence, a small number of individuals became responsible for the long-term sustainability of a large collective open source project, and the project rapidly fell prone to interpersonal conflict once consensus could no longer be reached among them.\n \n\tThis section will describe the specificities of the two-layered structure of the Bitcoin project and the mechanisms put in place to address these key challenges, in order to better understand any shortcomings they may display.\n \n\tAs described earlier, the Bitcoin network purports to be both   and  .   As a trustless infrastructure, it seeks to function independently of any social institutions. The rules governing the platform are not enforced by any single entity, instead they are embedded directly into the network protocol that every user must abide to.  \n \n\tGiven the open and decentralised nature of the Bitcoin network, its   are extremely flexible and dynamic, in that everyone is free to participate and contribute to the network \u2013 either as a passive user or as an active miner. The decentralised character of the network however, creates significant challenges when it comes to the protection thereof, mainly due to the lack of a centralised authority in charge of policing it. Bitcoin thus implemented a technical solution to protect the network against malicious attacks (e.g. so-called  ) through the Proof-of-Work mechanism, designed to make it economically expensive to cheat the network. Yet, while the protocol has proved successful thus far, it remains subject to a lot of criticism. Beyond the problems related to the high computational costs of Proof-of-Work,   the Bitcoin network can also be co-opted by capital. If one or more colluding actors were to control at least 51% of the network\u2019s hashing power, they would be able to arbitrarily censor transactions by validating certain blocks at the expense of others (the so-called 51% attack).\n \n\tWith regard to  , the Bitcoin protocol eliminates the problem at the root by creating a trustless infrastructure where the identity of the participant nodes is entirely irrelevant. In Bitcoin, there is no centralised authority in charge of assigning a network identifier (or account) to each individual node. The notions of identity and status are thus eradicated from the system and the only thing that matters \u2013 ultimately \u2013 is the amount of computational resources that every node is providing to the network.\n \n\tConversely, the reward system represents one of the constitutive elements of the Bitcoin network. The challenge has been resolved in a purely technical manner by the Bitcoin protocol, through the notion of  . In addition to providing a protection mechanism, the Proof-of-Work algorithm introduces a series of economic incentives to reward those who are contributing to maintaining and securing the network with their computational resources (or  ). The mining algorithm is such that the first one to find the solution to a hard mathematical problem (whose difficulty increases over time)   will be able to register a new block into the blockchain and will earn a specific amount of bitcoins as a reward (the reward was initially set at 50 bitcoins and is designed to be halved every four years). From a game-theoretical perspective, this creates an interesting incentive for all network participants to provide more and more resources to the network, so as to increase their chances of being rewarded bitcoins.   Bitcoin\u2019s incentive mechanism is thus a complicated, albeit mathematically elegant way of bringing a decentralised network of self-interested actors to collaborate and contribute to the operations of the Bitcoin network by relying exclusively on mathematical algorithms and cryptography. Over time, however, the growing difficulty of mining due to the increasing amount of computational resources engaged in the network, combined with the decreasing amount of rewards awarded by the network, has eventually led to a progressive concentration of hashing power into a few *mining pools, *which are today controlling a large majority of the Bitcoin network \u2013 thereby making it more vulnerable to a 51% attack.   Hence, in spite of its original design as a fully decentralised network ruled by distributed consensus, in practice, the Bitcoin network has evolved into a highly centralised network ruled by an increasingly oligopolistic market structure.\n \n\tFinally, with regard to the issue of  , it is first important to determine what constitutes a conflict at the level of the Bitcoin infrastructure. If the purpose of the Bitcoin protocol is for a decentralised network of peers to reach consensus as to what is the right set of transactions (or  ) that should be recorded into the Bitcoin blockchain, then a conflict arises whenever two alternative blocks (which are both valid from a purely mathematical standpoint) are registered by different network participants in the same blockchain \u2013 thus creating two competing versions (or  ) of the same blockchain. Given that there is no way of deciding   which blockchain should be favoured over the other, the Bitcoin protocol implements a specific fork-choice strategy stipulating that, if there is a conflict somewhere on the network, the longest chain shall win.   Again, as with the former two mechanisms, the longest-chain rule is a simple and straightforward mechanism to resolve the emergence of conflicts within the Bitcoin network by relying \u2013 solely and exclusively \u2013 on technological means.\n \n\tIt is clear from this description, that the objective of Satoshi Nakamoto and the early Bitcoin developers was to create a decentralised payment system that is both self-sufficient and self-contained. Perhaps naively, they thought it was possible to create a new technological infrastructure that would be able to govern itself \u2013 through its own protocols and rules \u2013 and that would not require any third-party intervention in order to sustain itself. And yet, in spite of the mathematical elegance of the overall system, once introduced in a particular socio-economic context, technological systems often evolve in unforeseen ways and may fall prey to unexpected power relations.\n \n\tIn the short history of Bitcoin, indeed, there have been significant tensions related to  ,   and  . Some of these issues are inherent in the technological infrastructure and design of the Bitcoin protocol. Perhaps one of the most revealing of the possible ways of subverting the system is the notion of   whereby miners can increase their potential returns by refusing to cooperate with the rest of the network.   While this does not constitute a technical threat to the Bitcoin protocol  , it can nonetheless be regarded as an  , which contributes to potentially reducing the security of the Bitcoin network by changing the inherent incentive structure.   Other issues emerged as a result of more exogenous factors, such as the Mt. Gox scandal   of 2014 \u2013 which led to the loss of 774,000 bitcoins (worth more than US 450 million dollars at the time) \u2013 as well as many other scams and thefts that occurred on the Bitcoin network over the years.   Most of these were not due to an actual flaw in the Bitcoin protocol, but were mostly the result of ill-intentioned individuals and bad security measures in centralised platforms built on top of the Bitcoin network (Trautman, 2014).\n \n\tAccordingly, it might be worth considering whether \u2013 independently of the technical soundness of the Bitcoin protocol \u2013 the Bitcoin network can actually do away with any form of external regulation and/or sanctioning bodies, or whether, in order to ensure the proper integration (and assimilation) of such a technological artefact within the social, economic and cultural contexts of modern societies, the Bitcoin network might require some form of surveillance and arbitration mechanisms (either internal or external to the system) in order to preserve legitimate market dynamics, as well as to guarantee a proper level of consumer protection and financial stability in the system.\n \n\tJust like many other internet protocols, Bitcoin was initially released as an open source software, encouraging people to review the code and spontaneously contribute to it. Despite their formal emphasis on  , different open source software projects and communities feature very different social and organisational structures. The analysis of communication patterns among various open source projects has shown tendencies ranging from highly distributed exchanges between core developers and active users, to high degrees of centralisation around a single developer (Crowston & Howison, 2005). Moreover, different open source communities enjoy a more or less formalised governance structure, which often evolves as the project matures. Broadly speaking, open source communities have been categorised into two main types or configurations:   versus \u201cautocratic-mechanistic\u201d (de Laat, 2007). The former display a highly structured and meritocratic governance system (such as the Debian community, most notably), whereas the latter feature less sophisticated and more implicit governance systems, such as the Linux community, where most of the decision-making power has remained in the hands of Linus Torvald \u2013 often referred to as the \u201cbenevolent dictator\u2019. Bitcoin definitely falls into the second category.\n \n\tIndeed, since its inception, Satoshi Nakamoto was the main person in charge of managing the project, as well as the only person with the right to commit code into the official Bitcoin repository. It was only at a later stage, when Satoshi began to disengage from the Bitcoin project, that this power was eventually transferred to a small group of \u2018core developers\u2019. Hence, just like many other open source projects, there is a discrepancy between those who can provide input to the project (the community at large) and those who have the ultimate call as to where the project is going. Indeed, while anyone is entitled to submit changes to the software (such as bug fixes, incremental improvements, etc.), only a small number of individuals (the core developers) have the power to decide which changes shall be incorporated into the main branch of the software. This is justified partly by the high level of technical expertise needed to properly assess the proposed changes, but also \u2013 more implicitly \u2013 by the fact that the core developers have been entrusted with the responsibility of looking after the project, on the grounds of their involvement (and, to some extent, shared  ) with the original concept of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n \n\tWith this in mind, we can now provide a second perspective on the three key challenges facing Bitcoin, and analyse how they are being dealt with from the side of its  : the Bitcoin developers.\n \n\tThe  , and of the work produced collectively, is a key issue in open source collectives. It classically finds a solution through the setting up of an alternative intellectual property regime and licensing scheme \u2013  , which ensures that the work will be preserved as a common pool resource \u2013 but also enforces a number of organisational features and rules intended to preserve some control over the project (O'Mahony, 2003; Schweik & English, 2007). In the case of Bitcoin, community borders are \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 quite clearly defined. Just like many other open source software projects, there exists a dividing line between the community of users and developers at large, who can provide input and suggest modifications to the code (by making a pull-request, for instance), and the core developers who are in charge of preserving the quality and the functionality of the code, and who are the only ones with the power to accept (or refuse) the proposed modifications (e.g. by merging pull-requests into the main branch of the code). However, the distinction between these two communities is not as clear-cut as it may seem, since the community at large also has an important (albeit indirect) influence on the decisions concerning the code.\n \n\tSpecifically, consensus formation among the Bitcoin core developers has been formalised through a process known as Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)  , which builds heavily on the process in place for managing the Python programming language (PEPs or Python Enhancement Proposals). Historically, both of these processes share similarities with (and sometimes explicitly refer to) what can be considered the \u201ccanonical\u201d approach to consensus formation for designing and documenting network protocols: RFC or Request For Comments, used to create and develop the internet protocol suite (Flichy, 2007, p. 35ff). The BIP process requires that all source code and documentation be released and made available to anyone, so that a multiplicity of individuals can contribute to discuss and improve them. Yet, the final call as to whether a change will be implemented ultimately relies on the core developers assessing the degree of public support which a proposal has built, and finding a consensus among themselves:\n \n\t\tWe are fairly liberal with approving BIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred. Having a BIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Active. For a BIP to become Active requires the mutual consent of the community. Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Bitcoin users.  \n\t \n\tThis description provides a concise overview of the structures of legitimacy and accountability which govern the relationship between the Bitcoin architects (or core developers) and the Bitcoin users. While the community is open for anyone to participate, decision-making is delegated to a small number of people who try to keep intervention to a minimum. Yet, ultimately, the sovereignty of the overall project rests with   \u2013\u00a0i.e. the Bitcoin users and miners. If the core developers were to make a modification to the code that the community disagrees with (the miners, in particular), the community might simply refuse to run the new code. This can be regarded as a form of \u201cvetoing power\u2019   or \u201cmarket-based governance\u2019   which guarantees that legitimacy of the code ultimately rests with the users.\n \n\tRegarding  , this requires balancing rewards for the most active and competent contributors, while promoting and maintaining the collective character of the overall endeavour. Indeed, open source developers are acutely aware of the symbolic retributions which they can acquire by taking part in a given project, and are also monitoring other contributors to assess their position within communities which display a strongly meritocratic orientation (Stewart, 2005). Some communities rank individuals by resorting to systems of marks which provide a quantitative metric for reputation; others rely on much less formalised forms of evaluation. In the case of Bitcoin, some measure of reputation can be derived from the platform used to manage the versioning of the software \u2013   \u2013 which includes metrics for users\" activities (such as number of contributions, number of followers, etc.). However, the reputation of the core developers is on a completely different scale, and is mostly derived from their actual merit or technical expertise, as well as a series of less easily defined individual qualities which can be understood as a form of  .\n \n\tFinally,     is probably the most difficult issue to deal with in consensus-oriented communities, since it requires a way to avoid both     and    . Taking Wikipedia as an example, the community relies on specific mechanisms of mutual surveillance as the most basic way of managing conflicts; however, additional regulatory procedures of mediation and sanctions have been established and can be resorted to if needed (Auray, 2012, p. 225). The Debian community is also well known for its sophisticated rules and procedures (Lazaro, 2008). Though not immune to deadlocks and fighting, these communities have managed to scale while maintaining some degree of inclusivity, by shifting contentious issues from   to   grounds \u2013 thus limiting the opportunities for personal disputes and   attacks.\n \n\tObviously, the Bitcoin community lacks any such form of conflict management procedures. As described above, failure to reach consensus among the core developers concerning the block size dispute led to an actual forking of the Bitcoin project. Forking is a process whereby two (or more) software alternatives are provided to the user base, who will therefore need to make a choice: the adoption rate will ultimately determine which branch of the project will win the competition, or whether they will both evolve as two separate branches of the same software. Forking is standard practice in free/  and open source software development, and although it can be seen as a last resort solution which can sometimes put the survival of a project at risk (Robles & Gonz\u00e1lez-Barahona, 2012), it can also be considered a key feature of its governance mechanisms. For Nyman and Lindman:   \u2013 it is a reminder that developers have the essential freedom to take the code wherever they want, and this freedom also functions as a looming threat of division that binds the developer community together (Nyman & Lindman, 2013).\n \n\tIn sum, it can be stressed that, at all three levels (defining borders, acknowledging status, and managing conflicts), the governance of the Bitcoin project relies almost exclusively on its leaders, lending credit to the view that peer production can often lead to the formation of oligarchic organisational forms (Shaw & Hill, 2014). More specifically, in classic weberian terms \u2013 and as can often be observed in online communities \u2013 Bitcoin governance consists in a form of domination based on charismatic authority (O'Neil, 2014), largely founded on presumed technical expertise. The recent crisis experienced by the Bitcoin community revealed the limits of consensus formation between individuals driven by sometimes diverging political and commercial interests, and underlined the discrepancies between the overall goals of the project (a self-regulating decentralised virtual currency and payment system) and the excessively centralised and technocratic elites who are in charge of the project.\n \n\t  (latin for:  ) was the motto printed on the first physical Bitcoin wallets   \u2013 perhaps as an ironic reference to the \u201c  motto printed on US dollar bills. In the early days, the political objectives of Bitcoin were clearly and explicitly stated through the desire of changing existing power dynamics between individuals and the state.   Yet, while some people use Bitcoin as a vehicle for expressing their political views (e.g. the community of so-called cypherpunks and  ), others believe that there is no real political ideology expressed within the technology itself.   Indeed, if asked, many will say that one of the core benefits of Bitcoin is that it operates beyond the scope of governments, politics, and central banks.   But it does not take much of a stretch to realise that this desire to remain   constitutes a political dimension in and of itself (Kostakis & Giotitsas, 2014).\n \n\tDecentralisation inherently affects political structures by removing a control point. Regarding Bitcoin, decentralisation is achieved through a peer-to-peer payment system that operates independently of any (trusted) third party. As a result, not only does Bitcoin question one of the main prerogatives of the state \u2013 that of money issuance and regulation, it also sheds doubts on the need (and, therefore, the legitimacy) of existing financial institutions. On the one hand, as a decentralised platform for financial transactions, Bitcoin sets a limit on the power of central banks and other financial institutions to define the terms and conditions, and control the execution of financial transactions. On the other hand, by enabling greater disintermediation, the Bitcoin blockchain provides new ways for people to coordinate themselves without relying on a centralised third party or trusted authority, thus potentially promoting individual freedoms and emancipation.   More generally, the blockchain is now raising high hopes as a solution which, beyond a payments system, could support many forms of direct interactions between free and equal individuals \u2013 with the implicit assumption that this would contribute to furthering democratic goals by promoting a more horizontal and self-organising social structure (Clippinger & Bollier, 2014).\n \n\tAs Bitcoin evolves \u2013 and in the eventuality that it gets more broadly adopted \u2013 it will need to face a growing number of technical challenges (e.g. related to blockchain scalability), but it will also encounter a variety of social and political challenges \u2013 as the technology will continue to impinge upon existing social and governmental institutions, ushering in an increasingly divergent mix of political positions.\n \n\tThe mistake of the Bitcoin community was to believe that, once technical governance had been worked out, the need to rely on government institutions and centralised organisations in order to manage and regulate social interactions would eventually disappear (Atzori, 2015; Scott, 2014). Politics would progressively give way to new forms of technologically-driven protocols for social coordination (Abramowicz, 2015) \u2013 regarded as a more efficient way for individuals to cooperate towards the achievement of a collective goal while preserving their individual autonomy.\n \n\tYet, one cannot get rid of politics through technology alone, because the governance of a technology is \u2013 itself \u2013 inherently tied to a wide range of power dynamics. As Yochai Benkler elegantly puts it, there are no   only different sets of constraints that one necessarily must choose from (Benkler, 2006). Bitcoin as a trustless technology might perhaps escape the existing political framework of governmental and market institutions; yet, it remains subject to the (invisible) politics of a handful of individuals \u2013 the programmers who are in charge of developing the technology and, to a large extent, deciding upon its functionalities.\n \n\tImplicit in the governance structure of Bitcoin is the idea that the Bitcoin core developers (together with a small number of technical experts) are \u2013 by virtue of their technical expertise \u2013 the most likely to come up with the right decision as to the specific set of technical features that should be implemented in the platform. Such a   approach to governance is problematic in that it goes counter to the original conception of the Bitcoin project. There exists, therefore, an obvious discrepancy between the libertarian vision of Bitcoin as a decentralised infrastructure that cannot be regulated by any third party institution, and the actual governance structure that dictates the technological development of Bitcoin \u2013 which, in spite of its open source nature, is highly centralised and undemocratic. While the (a)political dimension of the former has been praised or at least acknowledged by many, the latter has remained, for a long time, invisible to the public: the technical decisions to be taken by the Bitcoin developers were not presented as political decisions, and were therefore never debated as such.\n \n\tThe block size debate is a good illustration of this tendency. Although the debate was framed as a value-neutral technical discussion, most of the arguments in favour or against increasing the size of a block were, in fact, part of a hidden political debate. Indeed, except for the few arguments concerning the need to preserve the security of the system, most of the arguments that animated the discussion were, ultimately, concerned with the socio-political implications of such a technical choice (e.g. supporting a larger amount of financial transactions versus preserving the decentralised nature of the network). Yet, insofar as the problem was presented as if it involved only rational and technical choices, the political dimensions which these choices might involve were not publicly acknowledged.\n \n\tMoreover, if one agrees that   (Winner, 1980) and that technology frames social practice (Kallinikos, 2011), it follows that the design and features of the Bitcoin platform must be carefully thought through by taking into account not only its impact on the technology as such (i.e. security and scalability concerns), but also its social and political implications on society at large.\n \n\tPolitics exist because, in many cases, consensus is hard to achieve, especially when issues pertaining to *social justice *need to be addressed. Social organisations are thus faced with the difficult challenge of accommodating incompatible and often irreconcilable interests and values. The solutions found by modern day liberal democracies involve strong elements of   and  . The underlying assumption is that the only way to ensure the   of collective decisions is by making conflicts apparent and by discussing and challenging ideas within the public sphere (Habermas, 1989). Public deliberations and argumentation are also necessary to achieve a greater degree of   in collective decisions, as well as to ensure full   and   of the ways in which these decisions are both made and put into practice. But the antagonistic dimensions of social life constantly undermine the opportunities for consensus formation. A truly democratic approach needs, therefore, to acknowledge \u2013 and, ideally, to balance or compromise \u2013 these spaces of     which are the most revealing of embedded power relations (Mouffe & Laclau, 2001; Mouffe, 1993).\n \n\tThis is perhaps even more crucial for technologies such as the internet or Bitcoin, which seek to implement a global and shared infrastructure for new forms of coordination and exchange. Bitcoin as an   must be understood here as a means of introducing and shaping a certain type of social relations (Star, 1999; Bowker et al., 2010). Yet, just like many other infrastructures, Bitcoin is mostly an   technology that operates in the background (Star & Strauss, 1999). It is, therefore, all the more important to make the design choices lying behind its technical features more visible, in order to shed light on the politics which are implicit in the technological design.\n \n\tIt should be clear, by now, that the political intentions of a technology cannot be resolved, only and exclusively, by technological means. While technology can be used to steer and mediate many kinds of social interactions, it should not (and cannot) be the sole and main driver of social change. As Bitcoin has shown, it is unrealistic to believe that human organisations can be governed by relying exclusively on algorithmic rules. In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of these organisations, it is necessary to incorporate, on top of the technical framework, a specific governance structure that enables people to discuss and coordinate themselves in an authentically democratic way, but also \u2013 and perhaps more importantly \u2013 to engage and come up with decisions as to how the technology should evolve. In that regard, one should always be wary that the decision-making process involve not only those who are building the technology (i.e. developers and software engineers) but also all those who will ultimately be affected by these decisions (i.e. the users of that technology).\n \n\tDifferent dimensions of the internet have already been analysed from such a perspective within the broader framework of internet governance (DeNardis, 2012; Musiani et al., 2016), providing important insights about the performative dimensions of the underlying software and protocols, and the ways they have been put to use. These could prove useful in better understanding and formulating a novel governance structure for the Bitcoin project \u2013 one that is mediated (rather than dictated) by technological rules.\n \n\tThe internet, understood as a complex and heterogeneous socio-technical construct, combines many different types of arrangements \u2013 involving social norms, legal rules and procedures, market practices and technological solutions \u2013 which, taken together, constitute its overall governance and power structures (Brousseau, Marzouki, & M\u00e9adel, 2012). Most of the research on internet governance has focused on the interplay between   on the one hand, and   or institutions on the other \u2013 particularly those which have emerged on top of the network during the course of its history (such as ICANN or IETF), sometimes generating conflictual relationships with existing national and international legal frameworks, private corporations, or even civil society at large (Mueller, 2002; Mueller, 2010; Mathiason, 2009; DeNardis, 2009; Bygrave & Bing, 2009).  \n \n\tInternet governance has been fraught with many frictions, controversies and disputes over the years \u2013 an international fight to control the basic rules and protocols of the internet described by some as a   (DeNardis, 2014). Even the much praised governance model of the internet protocol suite \u2013 based on the IETF\u2019s (deceptively simple) rule of  \u201d \u2013 effectively involved, at certain points, fair amounts of power struggles and even autocratic design (Russell, 2014). The idea that consensus over technical issues can be reached more easily because it only involves objective criteria and factual observations (i.e. something either works or doesn\u2019t) neglects the reality that \u201cstories about standards are necessarily about power and control \u2013 they always either reify or change existing conditions and are always conscious attempts to shape the future in specific ways\u201d (Russell, 2012).\n \n\tSet within the wider frame and history of internet governance, the Bitcoin case is particularly instructive insofar as it draws on a certain number of new, but also already existing practices, to promote some of the ideals which have been associated with the internet since its inception: furthering individual autonomy and supporting collective self-organisation (Loveluck, 2015). As we have seen, Bitcoin can be understood as a dual-layered construct, composed of a global network infrastructure on the one hand, and a small community of developers on the other. Although the   of the network seeks to obliviate the need for a central control point, in practice, as soon as a technology is deployed, new issues emerge from unanticipated uses of technology \u2013 which ultimately require the setting up of social institutions in order to protect or regulate the technology. These institutions can be more or less attuned with the overall aims of the technology, and can steer it in different directions. For instance, while the IETF managed to implement a relatively decentralised and bottom-up process for establishing standards, the Domain Name System (DNS) has shown that even a distributed network might, at some point, need to rely on a centralised control point to administer   (such as domain names). This has led to the emergence of centralised \u2013 and somewhat contested \u2013 institutions, such as, most notably, the ICANN \u2013 a US-based non-profit corporation that is in charge of coordinating all unique identifiers across the world wide web.\n \n\tThe lessons from the past \u2013 taking account of both the success stories and failures of internet governance \u2013 can serve as useful indications as to what should be attempted or, on the contrary, avoided in terms of Bitcoin governance. In particular, it should be acknowledged that socio-technical systems cannot \u2013 by virtue of their embeddedness into a social and cultural context \u2013 ensure their own   and   through technology alone. Any technology will eventually fall prey to the social, cultural and political pressures of the context in which it operates, which will very probably make it grow and evolve in unanticipated directions (Akrich, 1989; MacKenzie & Wajcman, 1999).\n \n\tThe Bitcoin project has evolved significantly over the years, for reasons which are both endogenous and exogenous to the system. From a small network run by a few crypto-libertarians and computer geeks eager to experiment with a new   (Diamond, 2010), the Bitcoin network quickly scaled into a global network which is struggling to meet the new demands and expectations of its growing user base and stakeholders.\n \n\tThe block size debate created an actual schism within the Bitcoin community \u2013 and, by doing so, ultimately stressed the need for a more democratic governance system. Drawing on the many different arrangements which have been experienced at different levels of internet governance, each with their own distinctive forms of deliberation and decision-making procedures (Badouard et al., 2012), the Bitcoin development process could perhaps be improved by introducing an alternative governance structure that would better account for the many other dimensions (other than technical) that the technology might have, especially with regard to its social, economic and political implications on society at large.\n \n\tThe Bitcoin Foundation was a first attempt in this direction, though it never managed to establish itself as a standardisation body precisely due to a lack of legitimacy and accountability in its own governance process. A centralised governance body (similar to ICANN) in charge of ensuring the legitimacy and accountability for the future developments of the Bitcoin project would obviously fail to obtain any kind of legitimacy from within the Bitcoin community \u2013 since eliminating the need for fiduciary institutions or other centralised authorities was the very purpose of the Bitcoin network. The technologically-driven approach currently endorsed by the Bitcoin project, aiming to create a governance structure that is solely and exclusively dictated by technological means ( ) has also been shown to be bound to failure, since a purely technological system cannot fully account for the whole spectrum (and complexity) of social interactions. In this regard, one of the main limitations of the Bitcoin protocol is that it is based on algorithmically quantifiable and verifiable actions (i.e. how much computing resources people are investing in the network) and it is therefore unable to reward those who contribute to the network in different manners, other than through hashing power.\n \n\tA more interesting approach would involve using the underlying technology \u2013 the   \u2013 not as a   that will technologically enforce a particular set of predefined protocols and rules (as Bitcoin does), but rather as a platform on which people might encode their own sets of rules and procedures that will define a particular system of governance \u2013 one that can benefit from the distinctive characteristics of the blockchain (in terms of transparency, traceability, accountability, and incorruptibility) but would also leave room for the establishment of an institutional framework that could operate on top of that (decentralised) network. This would make sure that technology remains a tool of empowerment for people, who would use it to enable and support new models of governance, rather than the opposite.\n \n\tGiven the experimental nature and current lack of maturity of the technology, it is difficult to predict, at this specific point in time, what would be the best strategy to ensure that the Bitcoin project evolves in accordance with the interests of all relevant stakeholders. Yet, regardless of the approach taken, it is our belief that a proper governance structure for Bitcoin can only be achieved by publicly acknowledging its political dimensions, and replacing the current technocratic power structure of the Bitcoin project with an institutional framework capable of understanding (and accommodating) the politics inherent in each of its technical features.\n", "postAuthor": "bvalis", "postDate": "10/25/2016 06:57  AM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Sr. Member", "authorPostCount": "100", "postLikes": "2"},

Our rate is 3 USD per H/s per year. Mining offer starts at 150 USD for 1 year of Zcash mining with 50 H/s. \n\tWebsite :  \n\t- Zcash cloud mining contracts \n\t- You can pay with Paypal \n\t- Up to 3 months bonus \n\t- Simple interfaces and statistics \n\t- Realtime tracking of mining performance \n\t- Engaging graphics that will inform and entertain you \n\t- Efficient hardware and software we take care of \n\t- Profitable mining that we continuously perfect \n\t- And daily payouts from as little as 0.0001 Zcash \n\tAfter over 10 successful years in web hosting we realized the potential of Zcash cloud mining and decided to start this business with the simple concept of putting our customers first in everything we do. We believe you will feel the difference from the first moment you engage with us. \n\tWe have often been asked why our customers should not simply buy their own hardware and start mining Zcash themselves. The answer is TCO, which stands for Total Cost of Ownership. Profitable Zcash mining requires constant processing. And that requires constant power and cooling. Do you have any idea how much that costs? \n\tOur datacenter in Quebec, Canada, benefits from 2 mayor advantages that allow us to easily beat our competitors: one of the lowest electricity rates in the world (about 75% lower than in most countries) and around 7 months of winter (during which we do not need to spend on cooling). In fact, when we look at electricity we have another argument that speaks for us. Sustainability! The only two other places in the world that can compete with Canada on cheap electricity are China and India, where fossil fuels like coal are the main source of energy. \n\tYou will be pleased to hear that our electricity comes 100% from Hydro Quebec, and that stands for beautiful renewable energy. 100% clean and natural. You see, it is not only the low cost that matters, it is the responsible choice to protect our planet that makes mining with us feel so good. \n\tHappy mining! \n\t-- \n\tJonathan Forte \n\tGPU Mining (by FD Canada Inc) \n\tgpumining.co\n", "postAuthor": "cpuminingio", "postDate": "11/15/2016 04:18  AM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Newbie", "authorPostCount": 0, "postLikes": 0},

{"url": "https://www.cryptotalk.org/index.php?/topic/546-gpuminingco-zcash-cloud-mining-contracts-paypal-accepted/", "postText": "\n\tWhat a year 2016 was! \n\t\u00a0 \n\tWe know this is a long message that will take you some time to read. We hope you can spare the time and read it all, because this email is packed with important updates.\n \n\tLet us get started... \n\t\u00a0 \n\tVery soon we will have amazing news to share with you, though for now all we can tell you is that we have grown much faster than we thought. Our lives have been reduced to building mining rigs and meeting wealthy investors. It has been a blast and we are most definitely not complaining. Watch this space. We are almost there and will make the announcement soon! \n\t\u00a0 \n\tIn the spirit of putting our customers first and after realizing that trust is the by far biggest obstacle for many of our investors, we decided to change our corporate structure. We do not blame our customers, because we know about all the negative events that surrounded mining companies in the past years. That is why we started GPU Mining in the first place, because we were certain that there is a market for an honest and trustworthy partner in Zcash mining. What have we done? We have changed the legal structure of GPU Mining on the 28th of December 2016 into a partnership! Not sure what that means? Most companies are incorporated with limited liability, which basically means that if things go bad, they are only liable with whatever assets the company holds. This allows some companies to amass mountains of debt and then declare bankruptcy. A partnership is very different. In a partnership, the partners are 100% liable for whatever the company does. This is a significant change and proves that we are 100% behind GPU Mining! \n\t\u00a0 \n\tThis is our biggest and most customer-focused update to date. It has been extremely difficult to code and we needed many iterations until we have gotten it right. And we are very proud. You surely know already that we offer 2-year contracts for 2 USD per H/s per year, 1-year contracts for 3 USD per H/s per year, and 6-month contracts for 4 USD per H/s per year. Now we are offering you contract management options, because we felt it was not fair that new customers could buy a contract for 2 USD per H/s per year where existing customers paid 3 USD per H/s per year, simply because back then we did not have 6-month or 1-year options. Therefore, we have today launched the following contract management options: \n\t\u00a0 \n\tConsolidate: \n\tSelect multiple contracts to merge them into one that has the end-date of the longest running contract.\n \n\tUpgrade: \n\tChange a 6-month contract into a 1-year or 2-year contract or a 1-year contract into a 2-year contract and only pay the difference to what you would have paid if you had bought the longer running contract at the beginning. This is only possible during the first half of a contract life. \n\t\u00a0 \n\tExtend: \n\tExtend any contract by 1 or 2 years and pay a discounted price over a new contract purchase. \n\t\u00a0 \n\tWe used to offer bonus months for contracts, depending on the contract size purchased. As you probably noticed, we stopped doing this a while ago. \n\t\u00a0 \n\tWe are currently offering commission to customers finding new customers. We are stopping this with the 31st of January 2017.\n \n\t \n\tWe are currently offering 5% extra for purchases through our Facebook page. We are stopping this as well with the 31st of January 2017. \n\t\u00a0 \n\tWe are excited to tell you that we are now running with our 2nd generation of mining hardware and it has proven very reliable. We are constantly improving our offering and never stop making our mining rigs more efficient and more reliable, so that we can offer you better services and continuous uninterrupted mining. \n\t\u00a0 \n\tWe realized that one of the numbers we were always calculating ourselves was the average mining performance over the past 7 days. And as you probably want to know this for your contracts too, we added this in the customer dashboard. \n\t\u00a0 \n\tFinally, we changed the information provided in the header of the customer section from 'Total Zcash mined' to 'Zcash balance,' as this is probably more interesting to know. \n\t\u00a0 \n\t\u00a0 \n\tOkay, for this is it for now.\n \n\tDid you reads it all? \n\tWe are proud of you! \n\t\u00a0 \n\tHappy mining, awesome customer! \n\t\u00a0 \n\tYour Zcash Mining Team\n \n\t \n\t---\n \n\t \n\tBuy one of our incredible Zcash mining contracts and claim your 5% bonus hashrate. Remember that we will stop offering this from January 31!\n \n\t \n", "postAuthor": "cpuminingio", "postDate": "01/07/2017 05:29  AM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Newbie", "authorPostCount": 0, "postLikes": 0},

While many common computer file types have the ability to track and store changes to documents (Document Object Model, for example), often this feature must be enabled by the user and does not necessarily retain all information of interest for a document. In addition, many computer file types have no ability to store such information and any tracking is left to the operating system or filesystem on which the file can be found. When trying to determine the background of a file, users are often left with an incomplete picture of who created it, who modified it, and where the file has traveled. Existing systems in this area are domain specific and/or platform/operating system/application specific, and it is the aim of this Challenge to explore more universal solutions to the file tracking problem.\n\t\t \n\t\t\tTHE CHALLENGE\n\t\t \n\t\t\tnew ideas on how to automatically track and store creation and evolution information for any file on a given computer system. \u00a0Any proposed solution should address the following Solution Requirements:\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 Track and store the following information for every instance of a computer file: \n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Creation date, time, place, and creator. \n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Date, time, place, and user for any changes to the document content. \n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Date, time, place, and user for any changes to the security credentials of the document. \n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Date, time, place, and user for any views of the document. \n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 Function automatically to update and store required information in #1 without manual intervention. \n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 Required information is stored independently of the subject document. \n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 Function with any and every computer file type. \n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 Be operating system and filesystem independent. \n\t\t\t\u00a0 \u00a0 Keep the stored file information secure \u2013 locked (write once, read many) or requiring authentication to modify the information.\n\t\t \n\t\t\tFiles reside on a system with internet access, and solutions that require installation and execution of background processes are allowed.\u00a0\n\t\t \n\t\t\tLet us find new ideas on how to keep track of the evolution of all computer file types from their creation through to their most recent version.

STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM BAIKALMINER.COM !!! After weeks of research on Google and Youtube, I thought the Baikal Miner would be a good investment mining Dash coins at 300 MH/s using only 75 Watt of power. Boy was I in for the biggest SCAM and RIPOFF and RIDE of my life!!! After one month of Baikal Miner hustling and scamming me, he stole $4676 and I am now stuck with a defective Baikal Miner Cube. I am now still SHOCK and SO DISGUSTED of these people! This is why they don\u2019t accept credit card or paypal. Just bitcoin, dash or ethereum. I don\u2019t think there is any recourse or any way you can get the coins back from these people!\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tOn April 11, 2017, I pulled the trigger and sent baikalminer 0.7216068 BTC which equals to $876.02 USD. These people are very difficult to deal with and very slow to respond on email. Worst, they only take bitcoin and they are located halfway around the world in China. So this made me very concern. 8 days later on April 19, the unit arrived at my home. I emailed Baikal on what power supply to use and they won\u2019t recommend which power supply to buy or send me an ebay or Amazon link, they just said 12V 10A. I searched on Google, Amazon and ebay and end up buying 3 power supply from Amazon and ebay. The first P/S came home the end plug was too big and did not fit. Then a couple days later the two P/S I ordered on ebay arrived and this one fit. You would think spending $876 on a little box with a fan, heatsink and circuit board they would include a P/S. The box did not come with any manuals so I had to google to find the CUBE.pdf manual and figured everything out myself. When first powered up and log in with the default password baikal, the miner show down. It looks like they still have their dash wallet address on there. I setup an account on coinmine.pl and dash.suprnova.cc and added my account and dash wallet address to the Baikal Pool page. Doesn\u2019t matter what I do, the miner still show down.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tOn April 24, 2017, I emailed  . The following day, they email back ask me to skype them.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tOn Skype, they did not offer any technical support or troubleshooting at all. They kept on insisting I download and read the CUBE.pdf file.\n \n\tTheir support is shitty! Then they wanted me to ship the unit back at my expense to repair it. I wasn\u2019t happy at all!!! To make me happy, they offered a Quad unit at a discounted price. The miner cube is $800 + $76 Shipping. Total is $876. Quad is 4 miner cube so $800 x 4 = $3200. I already paid for the first miner cube so I just need to pay for the difference of $2326 and I have to ship the defective unit back. I wasn\u2019t happy paying more at a full price when I already received a defective unit. So they offer 5% discount + free shipping + power cable at $2166 more + $876 I originally paid.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tOn April 27 and 30, 2017, I sent them $2150 to upgrade to a Quad Cube ($900 in ETH and $1250 in BTC). As of this date, I have sent them\n \n\t$3026.02.\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tOn May 1, 2017, they offer me two baikal quads for $2400 instead of instead of $3400 .\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t \n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tOn May 2, 5 and 6, 2017, I sent them a total of $1650 in BT and ETH. After sending them the last payment, they said to me on skype \u201cHi my friend please contact us via email for the confirmation. thanks.\u201d And this is when the HORROR begins. I email them at   and they just pay dumb and said they never received my $$$ BTC and ETH. \n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\t05/02/17 Paid $800 BTC\n \n\t05/05/17 Paid $550 ETH\n \n\t05/06/17 FINAL payment $300 BTC\n \n\t\u00a0\n \n\tbaikalminer.com and all other baikalminer web site and all of the baikalminer on skype are the SAME people. They will hustle you in sending bitcoin, dash coins or Ethereum coins. They will steal your coins and you cannot do anything about it like me! I am very unlucky and very stupid to trust them! DON\u2019T buy anything from Baikal Miner or any other web site or anyone on Skype. They are all the same people. I will attached screen capture of my skype conversion with Baikal Mining and emails so you can read for yourself and share with families, friends, co-worker and the mining community. I FEEL SO SICK INSIDE. These people have stole $4676 of my hard earn money. VERY VERY SAD!

Quin is actually ageing beautifully, although, which he loans for the character of his or her place. \"Thirty-one as a protection, you happen to be kind of most likely inside your prime due to the fact you're form of seeing the sport just like a quarterback currently,\" Quin explained Thursday, through the Detroit Totally free Press. \"Quarterbacks genuinely hit their own excellent 28, 30, Thirty, 31, result in this is observe stuff a lot in different ways.

That can make clear exactly why he feels he has still in his prime for the forseeable future, then when joined with his or her shown commitment to Detroit, wants to find an additional cope done with the particular Elephants before this individual visits industry. It's also clearly as part of his best interest to obtain the package accomplished before this individual turns into a year, thirty day period, or maybe a day old. It's difficult to assess just how good a safety is by using traditional analytics, but the money-making statistic -- interceptions -- actually peaked with 7 in Quin's 2014 Seasoned Dish season. He is considering that noted half a dozen within the last 2 months put together, but could bring their durability  , symbolized through his or her 116-game engagement ability, towards the stand in discussions. \"Physique sensible, my body system feels good,\" Quin said. \"Playing protection, having the ability to enjoy wise, having the capacity to make use of human brain much more, cause a lots of occasions men and women move to safety later on of their career to incorporate a couple decades.

I would not feel there's going to be a change. Wed times are going to be precisely the same, category commissioner Ben Bunn stated Monday at the league's first-ever press day held with the Icehouse  .? I believe the nice modify, beneficial alter could be the resuming from the net send out in which we have been on previous a long time. We now have extended the group U16 as well as U18 travel squads for top institution handbags players in order to have fun playing the high school groups as well as travel groups. I do believe that's a good. The particular FWAHA was created in the spring, incorporating the particular city's youth and college baseball?leagues for you to unify handbags development in Fort Adam.Very last period, Bishop Dwenger won the category 2A condition championship, and Carroll ended up being the actual 4A runner-up. Capricorn should also be excellent, at the same time, obtaining reached the town finals last year, slipping on the Rechargers. I am fairly fired up, the actual Saints' Aiden Parrot said. I believe we are going to be considered a excellent staff this season.?(Objectives) might be a little (increased this year), probably far more wins. I think the bottom teams will surface somewhat greater in 2010. Some clubs lost a lot of players, a few clubs improved participants. The gamers are expecting the group to become small more robust in 2010, perhaps evaluating simply by a few months associated with offseason training. It will likely be diverse in a way that we are likely to be more as a product, along with the participants approaching, Leo's Jones Freeby explained. They are going to become hopefully much better throughout level of skill along with generate that will ability upward as well as raise the handbags inside Fortin David. We does several applications using AWP, do some off-ice exercises during the summer time in order to keep our own hip and legs below us, to stay in shape in addition to basic fitness. ... I believe it's really a fantastic replacement for possess those equipment so if you wished to stay fit whilst generating yourself to progress; it's really a easy way to preserve people legs underneath you together with recover whether that is physical or speed as well as things like which  . Previous Komet Lincoln Kaleigh Schrock, coach of the Peak City Panthers, wants toward the growing season to carry on working together with participants to boost the grade of high school graduation dance shoes within Fortin Adam  . Schrock also may serve as the actual FWAHA as a instruction movie director and also brain of person improvement.? I do think I've a lots of fun working with this particular party because I've been presently there before, he explained. We enjoyed at Snider (Smt Town) my personal sophomore 12 months, so it will be entertaining. I remember it enjoy it has been yesterday and what these types of children are under-going thus Now i'm developing a lot of enjoyable with them  , and the near future will be vivid pertaining to Snider moving forward. I do think one of many problems with senior high school baseball before is the fact that there has been lots of disparity involving the prime participants along with the bottom part participants in every crew, and i believe we can perform better task associated with linking which space (with the association) hence the high school graduation baseball is way better overall. areichel@jg.net\n", "postAuthor": "christianringo", "postDate": "09/22/2017 03:49  AM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Brand New", "authorPostCount": 0, "postLikes": 0},

{"url": "https://www.cryptotalk.org/index.php?/topic/1094-remind-the-players-that-they-were-facing-nothing-new/", "postText": "\n\tFalcons quarterback Matt Ryan hasn t felt much like an NFL MVP over the past two weeks. \n\tHe looked uncharacteristically sluggish in Sunday s 23 17 loss to Buffalo, throwing two interceptions and losing a fumble that was returned for a touchdown. \n\tRyan was at a disadvantage in the second half with starting receivers Julio Jones and Mohamed Sanu sidelined by injuries earlier in the game, but even those setbacks weren t enough for him to explain what went wrong. \n\tI ve certainly made a ton of mistakes throughout my career myself, Ryan said. It s disappointing. We re better than that. I m better than that from an offensive standpoint in terms of taking care of the ball. \n\tOf his three picks last week, Ryan was entirely responsible for just one of them  , and the impact was less with the Falcons winning at Detroit. \n\tAgainst Buffalo, the four time Pro Bowl selection threw a ball behind receiver Nick Williams that was intercepted with 3 27 remaining. Stephen Hauschka s 56 yard field goal put the Bills up six points just four plays later, but the third quarter was worse. \n\tRyan lost a fumble on a sack that Tre Davious White returned for a touchdown. He threw a long jump ball that 5 foot 8 Taylor Gabriel lost to safety Micah Hyde, who s 4 inches taller, at the Buffalo 12. \n\tRyan already has five picks this season. He had just seven last season while being honored as the league MVP and leading Atlanta to the Super Bowl. \n\tIt s just difficult to overcome a three turnover deficit, he said. We did it last week, but it was a little too much to overcome today. \n\tGRIND THEM DOWN \n\tSpeaking at the team meeting Saturday night, Buffalo coach Sean McDermott challenged the offensive line to do a better job at sustaining drives. The Bills had averaged just 72 yards rushing in the past two games. \n\tWe talked about it and we were a little bothered about that  , Richie Incognito said. We knew we had to take over this game, so it s exciting, man. \n\tBuffalo wore down the Atlanta defense with a 19 play, 82 yard drive that consumed 11 20 and ended early in the fourth quarter. The Bills took a 17 10 lead on Hauschka s 24 yard field goal. \n\tI honestly didn t know it was that long of a drive, man, Incognito said. You have to dig deep on those. \n\tGOOD TIMING FOR BYE \n\tThe ailing Falcons will make the most of needed time off over the next week. \n\tJones, their two time All Pro receiver, left the game late in the second quarter with a hip flexor and did not return. He was limited in practice last week with a back injury. \n\tSanu was sidelined in   \u00a0the third quarter by a hamstring injury and didn t return. \n\tAtlanta began the day without four starters \u2014 defensive end Vic Beasley hamstring , last year s NFL sacks leader, right tackle Ryan Schraeder concussion , free safety Ricardo Allen concussion and defensive end Courtney Upshaw ankle . \n\tThe Falcons next game is in two weeks at home against Miami. \n\tTAKE YOUR TIME \n\tMcDermott still had his three timeouts remaining in the game s final minute. Atlanta had none left, but McDermott decided to use one before the Falcons lined up for a fourth and 1 at the Buffalo 10. \n\tHe wanted to see what formation Atlanta preferred, but he also wanted to remind the players that they were facing nothing new. \n\tI do not know if there is another team in the league that practices situational football as much as we do, Bills defensive end Eddie Yarbrough said. It could be a situation from Mars, and chances are Coach McDermott and our team have drilled it. It was definitely just a time to just say, Hey  , guys, we ve done this before. This isn t our first rodeo. We ve drilled this a hundred times in practice to see what formation they came out in. Then, we had to adjust from there. \n\tTAKE THE FALL \n\tFalcons left tackle Jake Matthews took the blame for Ryan getting sacked in the third quarter and losing the big fumble. \n\tMatthews was beaten by defensive Jerry Hughes and couldn t keep the linebacker from reaching his QB. \n\tI ve got to run him around the pocket a little more, Matthews said. I ve just to get better. That s about it.\n", "postAuthor": "elvafeng", "postDate": "10/08/2017 09:15  AM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Brand New", "authorPostCount": 0, "postLikes": 0},

With that in just intellect, it season toward evaluate the roster with an eye versus the NFL draft. Here how Buffalo security stacks up. Defensive lineKyle Williams, Marcell Dareus, Jerel Deserving, Adolphus Washington, Deandre ColemanSome of the informative position avid gamers seem to be toward be going upon, together with Corbin Bryant and Leger Douzable. However a transfer in direction of Sean McDermott 4-3 styled assault assists advantage element criteria for Buffalo defensive line. Williams and Dareus are identified figures. Deserving, Washington, and Coleman all flashed at substitute occasions.Which is all very good, due to the fact this is not a Good draft course toward have to have an internal defensive lineman  . UCLA Eddie Vanderdoes and Alabama Dalvin Tomlinson could focus Buffalo with their pedigree - Vanderdoes as a past 5 star opportunity, and Tomlinson as a 4-star who performed for Nick Saban.Perceived will need LowEdge rusherJerry Hughes, Shaq Lawson, Lorenzo Alexander, Ryan Davis, Max VallesThis point community literally feels a little bit flimsy inspite of wearing 20.5 sacks among this kind of 4 players2016 seasons. Hughes gained a biggest payday with 2 directly 10 sack seasons, still although he arrived conclusion towards completing the engage in upon a variety of scenarios, he hasn eclipsed 6 sacks inside the previous 2 decades. Alexander gained extra sacks inside of 2016 than inside of his preceding 9 decades merged, and there no make certain he creates as a move rusher this 12 months. Lawson was nicely-recognised as a draft possibility, yet misplaced year in direction of a shoulder surgical procedures and simply just preferred up 2 sacks as a novice. Davis contains been a first rate backup in just his period within the league consequently considerably, and Valles is an athletic job participant. This is viewed as a incredibly effective benefit rusher study course. Versus classic ills-typeSEC alternatives which include Carl Lawson and Tim Williams, towards lower higher education avid gamers together with Derek Rivers and Trey Hendrickson, there are proficient go rushers and superb athletes scattered in the course of the starter community. Perceived will need MediumLinebackerPreston Brown, Reggie Ragland, Ramon HumberYeah, youe reading through that effectively. Except yourself depend Alexander as an off-the-ball linebacker, the Costs basically consist of a few of those people upon the roster. And just one of them forgotten remaining year with a torn ACL.Brown includes performed decently as a novice for Buffalo the remaining a few seasons. He not the speediest linebacker and he at times struggles towards consider upon blocks, still he retains his personal within the center of the business  . Ragland seemed such as a prodigal NFL linebacker inside faculty, albeit with his particular inquiries around tempo. Humber was respected upon exclusive groups for the Payments very last period. There is a significant marvel mark below, which factors Zach Brown. At 1 level he looked destined for greener pastures, however he not too long ago improved brokers and compensated a take a look at in direction of Buffalo. He would give Buffalo a crucial pace infusion, and upon a very long time period offer, would permit the workers in direction of sense smooth advertising Ragland and going upon towards Preston Brown following calendar year.If he doesn deliver his direction back again toward Buffalo, the staff is made up of a couple of Plans inside of the draft. Alabama linebacker Reuben Foster put together with Ragland inside of a person of college or university football great pairings, and is deemed a long run best 10 select. Haason Reddick, who performed defensive conclusion optimum not too long ago  , confirmed off these remarkable athleticism that groups count on the Temple defender in direction of crank out the change in direction of linebacker. Ohio State Raekwon McMillan is an additional reputation who consists of suit Buffalo profile inside of the further than. The huge speculate will dwell with Sean McDermott - does he consider he can attain a Luke Kuechly within this draft, or even a Thomas Davis?Perceived need to have Significant SafetyMicah Hyde, Jordan Poyer, Colt Anderson, Jonathan Dowling, Shamiel Gary, Joe PowellThis is not an inspiring listing, even if by yourself imagine that Hyde will begin at protection . Poyer is staying paid out rookie economic, with just 10 job commences inside of 4 seasons towards this actuality. Anderson popularity is upon unique groups, not as a defender. The other 3 are task styles. The Payments may well employ the service of an infusion of skill at the point. The good news is, this novice protection training course is surely stacked.Malik Hooker and Jamal Adams are the best 2. Hooker hasn been ready in direction of function out for groups as he recovers towards labrum surgical procedure, still his elite number and ball expertise includes groups envisioning Earl Thomas. Adams isn an elite athlete, nevertheless his mixture of quantity  , tackling, intelligence, and management is reminiscent of Brian Dawkins.Outside of them is a slew of gifted names. Michigan Jabrill Peppers is an green, athletic participant who flashed upcoming upon protection, offense, and distinctive groups. Obi Melifonwu freaky athleticism arrives in just a 6220 pound offer. Josh Jones and Marcus Williams are very good athletes within their private instantly. Budda Baker playmaking competencies include acquired him Tyrann Mathieu comparisons. The Expenses must incorporate at minimal a single protection within this draft.Perceived will need HighCornerbackRonald Darby, Micah Hyde, Kevon Seymour, Leonard Johnson, Charles Gaines, Marcus RobersonThis is how poorly Buffalo secondary element consists of fallen. Both theye inquiring an unproven task towards get started at security, or final year 6th spherical opt for Seymour will begin at cornerback, relying upon Hyde assignment. Hyde apart, Darby and Johnson are the merely avid gamers towards confirm almost everything within the NFL at this point. They don even contain plenty of cornerbacks towards market a complete detail chart, going into exercising camp.This cornerback program is furthermore remarkable, and the Charges ought to incorporate luck obtaining a rookie even within just spherical a few of the draft. The true ponder is which avid gamers will healthy Buffalo profile currently that theye relocating in the direction of a zone-major Protect 3 process underneath McDermott. A person participant upon their radar is Nate Hairston  , a working day a few chance against Temple. Desmond King, who was one particular of the easiest corners within the state inside 2015 yet is missing within just tempo, might be a minute spherical alternative.\n", "postAuthor": "thielen1", "postDate": "07/19/2017 01:52  AM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Brand New", "authorPostCount": 0, "postLikes": 0},

{"url": "https://www.cryptotalk.org/index.php?/topic/1093-washington-has-picked-up-where-he-left-off/", "postText": "\n\tBlogging The Boys will begin taking a look at some of the NFL Draft prospects that will be in the 2018 NFL Draft class. We\u2019ll try to do this on a Friday night or Saturday morning so you can pay attention to that player in their next game if you should so choose. Some weeks, we will look at potential targets that will be within the Cowboys\u2019 expected draft range. Others, we will highlight some of the elite members of the class. \n\tThis is the fourth week of this installment. Thus far, we have already taken a look at two defensive players one edge rusher and one cornerback and one offensive player offensive lineman . Today, we\u2019ll look at our second offensive player. \n\tThe Cowboys currently sit at 2 2 with a pivotal game against Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers this Sunday. The offense has only looked like itself one time this season \u2014 and it came in a loss when the offense only scored six points in the second half against the Los Angeles Rams. Defenses have game planned to stop Cole Beasley, and the Dak Prescott to Dez Bryant connection still hasn\u2019t worked out as hoped thus far. \n\tWould the Cowboys want to add another weapon to Dak Prescott\u2019s disposal to open things up for the entire offense? A deep threat would be a very tempting choice, as it would stretch the field, open things up for Dez and Bease, and even reduce the number of defenders in the box tasked with stopping Ezekiel Elliott. \n\tIf the Cowboys would consider such a move, here is one candidate that would fit that role. \n\tJames Washington \u2014 Wide Receiver, Oklahoma State \n\tJames Washington has been one of the more electrifying wide receivers in all of college football over the last few seasons. Along with quarterback Mason Rudolph  , Washington has been tearing up defenses week in and week out. His 4.4 speed and reliable hands has made Washington one of the deadlier deep threats in the game. \n\tWhile Dez Bryant, another former Oklahoma State wideout, is regarded as one of the ten best receivers in the National Football League, he doesn\u2019t possess the speed similar to the likes of Odell Beckham Jr.  , Antonio Brown, or Julio Jones. Developing a deep threat across the field from Dez would take this offense to an entirely different level. Secondaries would be wary of doubling Dez, it would be more of a challenge to play bracket coverage on Beasely and spy Dak, and it would be another reason not to stack the box against Zeke and company. \n\tJames Washington has been one of the more prolific wideouts in the nation since his sophomore season in Stillwater. Washington recorded 456 yards and six scores on just 28 catches as a freshman, but his numbers have improved more and more every season at OSU. His numbers jumped up to 1,087 yards and ten touchdowns on 53 receptions in 2015. His connection with Rudolph put fear in defenders\u2019 minds each and every Saturday. He was a consensus second team all conference after his sophomore campaign. \n\tAs a junior, Washington was even better. The Texas native set career highs in receptions and yards and tied his career high in scores. OSU\u2019s number one receiver hauled in 71 receptions for 1,380 yards and ten touchdowns. He is a threat to find the   \u00a0\u00a0end zone every single time he lines up out wide. Both the Big 12 media and the coaches around the conferences named Washington first team all conference in 2016. \n\tThis season, Washington has picked up where he left off. Through just five games in 2017, Washington has tied his freshman season in catches 28 , is over halfway to 1,000 yards 647 , and is already halfway there in tying his career high in touchdowns with five. He is averaging 129 yards per game this season with a high of 153 against TCU and a low of 98 against South Alabama in a game that was over before halftime and he still found the end zone . \n\tHis most impressive stat is that Washington\u2019s season low in yards per reception is 16.3 ! . The speedy deep threat averaged 16.3 yards on 28 receptions as a freshman, 20.5 on 53 as a sophomore, 19.4 on 71 as a junior, and is currently averaging 23.1 yards per catch on 28 catches this season. Needless to say, big things happen when you get the ball in 28\u2019s hands. \n\tWould Dallas draft a receiver in round one next April? Obviously we have ways to go, but it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea. As mentioned above, the addition of a deep threat would open lots of things for Dak Prescott, Zeke  , and company. CBS Sports\u2019 Chris Trapasso agrees \u2014 though , he goes with a different wideout \n\t18. Dallas Cowboys \n\tDeontay Burnett, WR, USC. Dallas is a team that needs a deep threat wideout on its roster. Burnett has good long speed and impeccable ball skills. He can provide some of what the Cowboys get from Cole Beasley yet stretch opposing defenses for Dak Prescott. \n\tJames Washington would be a big addition if the Cowboys opt to go that direction.\n", "postAuthor": "elvafeng", "postDate": "10/08/2017 09:14  AM", "quotedText": null, "authorRep": "Brand New", "authorPostCount": 0, "postLikes": 0},
